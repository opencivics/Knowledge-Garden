This “third horizon” thinking is pre-figurative and imaginal while remaining pragmatic and grounded. It opens a design space in which the next epoch of open civic systems may be explored and co-evolved through bottom-up, participatory means.

The framework scaffolds/represents a modular, interoperable, composable, and inclusive approach to civic innovation that models civic systems off of the development of open source software, stigmergic living systems patterns, open standards bodies, the symbiotic intelligence of an artistic or cultural scene, and commons self-governance principles.

This approach builds towards the innovation of civic systems as open protocols; open civic systems. A meta-protocol for composing civic systems as social organisms is offered as a pattern language that enables a participatory, pluralistic and polycentric approach. Effectively, this is an open protocol for producing open protocols.

Thus, this thesis attempts to offer a sketch of an underlying grammar [and/or syntax | logic] for distributed coordination, ie an open civics. This grammar proposes an underlying schema for self-organizing processes and resilient, place-based and cosmo-local infrastructures that provide the enabling conditions for a fundamentally post-capitalist and even post-nation state human civilization.

By providing an initial schema that correlates the fundamental categories, functions, and processes of distributed coordination, this thesis outlines both the core functions of OpenCivics Network as a set of mechanisms as well as a coherent, overarching framework for a fully participatory process of civilizational adaptation.

By linking the many commons and peer to peer efforts to revitalize the civic design space, this ontological framework provides a foundation for a fully distributed process, governed by those who engage in it. This model is not intended to be complete or final in any sense, rather it offers a schelling point, a point of convergence and underlying schema to coordinate the process of systemic adaptation and co-evo_lution._

As such, this model is intended to be co-evolved through participatory stewardship. Instead of proposing this framework as definitive or absolute, this thesis approaches design process as a necessary **minimum viable coordination mechanism** and continuously evolving scaffolding in support of the emergence and co-creation of interoperable, modular, and participatory open protocols.

Embracing the ontological shift into a worldview of interbeing, core societal functions are reframed as nested wholes that provide mutually reinforcing, cascading benefits for the social ecology within which they participate. By reimagining society’s infrastructures, incentives, and institutions through a fundamentally living systems lens, this framework is intended to support a broad societal shift into an ecological understanding of right relationship, reciprocity, and flow. Composing civic utilities in this context, the emergent social organisms that unfold are structured in a universal language of Life that supports the interoperable continuity, holonic nesting, and stigmergic coordination of human societal functions.

As an alignment and coordination strategy, composing social organisms utilizing this framework supports a commons process of participatory feedback and learning, allowing social organisms to evolve organically through a cosmo-local process of experimentation, iteration, and co-creation.

Civic utilities or civic stacks are composed of the fundamental building blocks or elements of social organisms that are fractal in nature and contain various self-referencing components that can be stacked and composed into living processes.

As a “negative space organization,” the OpenCivics Network is committed to activities that empower self-organized coordination and non-rivalrous network effects through mutually beneficial infrastructures and collaborative frameworks rather than activities that impose prescriptive agendas beyond our personal and system ethics which we see as fundamental preconditions to any distributed, participatory process. By offering coordination infrastructure through a plurality of organizational forms and their activities, OpenCivics’ Theory Of Change revolves around creating the enabling conditions for a distributed civic renaissance of innovation, participation and stewardship.


OpenCivics' activities are strategic functions designed to provide the necessary scaffolding for the emergent self-organization of sovereign actors towards a common goal. These actions are distributed across the three organizational structures to create positive feedback loops between civic innovators, patrons, and community organizers.

- **Align**
    
    [...]
    
- **Coordinate**
    
    When and where our strategies _do_ align, it is critical to move as a coordinated body, avoiding duplication where possible, and informing other civic innovators how they can support a shared effort.
    
    We create a space for co-sensing, convergence, collaboration and cooperation on public goods and commons infrastructures. By providing scaffolding for facilitation, ephemeral self-organization, and an Open Protocol Library for the dynamic synthesis and distribution of civic innovations, OpenCivics attends to the force multiplying synergies between projects by supporting active collaboration and a high trust network of innovator peers.
    
- **Resource**
    
    Civic innovation, because of its non-extractive nature, is often under-resourced. We aim to change that.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports resourcing through our grants program.
    
    We work with funding partners to develop and deploy multiple participatory grant making mechanisms that provide mission-critical funding to underserved innovators and community organizers. From direct grants to quadratic funding rounds to streaming grants, we’re committed to serving as a bridge between civic patrons, innovators and organizers by coordinating impact reporting and attestation and by operating participatory processes that empower our members, funders, and the public to co-determine grant allocations through democratic and transparent mechanisms.
    
- **Collaborate**
    
    Beyond coordination, sometimes we need to create something specific together for mutual benefit. Collaboration is often essential when initiatives overlap and have common needs and goals.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports collaboration through our initatives program.
    
    We support collaborative initiatives that create research and development artifacts that serve the commons. These initiatives leverage the principles of modularity, interoperability, composability, and inclusivity to ensure that the resulting solutions are adaptable, scalable, and accessible to all. By fostering a participatory approach, we empowers communities to co-create and share knowledge, tools, and resources that address local and global challenges, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society.
    
- **Convene**
    
    Non-rivalrous relationships thrive on experiences of connection and cross-pollination. We convene change makers to strengthen our network by sharing physical and digital space.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports convening through our gatherings program.
    
    We support the organizing of inclusive events, workshops, and forums, that create spaces where community members, experts, and policymakers can share insights, co-create solutions, and build networks. These gatherings are intended to be accessible and engaging, strengthening community bonds, inspiring collective action, and driving meaningful change.
    
- **Learn**
    
    We’re at our best when we’re sharing our learning with one another; our experiences that empower others with knowledge, frameworks, and peer learning for collective action.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports education through our academy program.
    
    Participatory learning enriches understanding, enhances capabilities, and strengthens communities. Peer learning builds trust, essential for overcoming challenges. This mutual sharing creates a growth cycle, highlighting diverse perspectives for impactful actions.
    
    In an effort to surface and amplify the rich content that exists abundantly within the civic innovation and adjacent fields, the program offers infrastructure to list existing course materials of multiple formats of learning in an open directory. We weave the work of network members into a distributed learning ecosystem for civic stewards to develop key capacities and to participate in co-development processes. This provides the an open, donation-based, project discovery dashboard for participatory learning.


- **Open Civic Protocols**
    
    As innovators align through open protocols, modular and interoperable civic utilities create a force multiplier for the rapid local adaptation of core civilizational systems. Local organizers are empowered to fork and merge open protocols while pushing their learnings and insights back into a global network, enabling a cosmo-local revolution in new forms of social organizing at the grassroots level. Templates, patterns, and civic stacks become easily discoverable and composable by community organizers as innovators work together to synthesize and interoperate their work.
    
- **Open Civic Utilities**
    
    As innovators receive funding and collaborate together on open protocols, capacity building utilities will be developed and distributed to the public who will then be empowered to refine and further co-develop them. Each of these tools will increase the public’s ability to self-organize around mutual needs and mutual benefits, supporting the competitiveness of non-enclosed and non-excludable infrastructures and to provide mechanisms for the public to opt out of dependencies on traditional corporate or governmental services into direct, participatory stewardship.

Beginning with a set of values and principles, the framework offers a set of theoretical foundations as a fundamental design philosophy for open civic innovation.

## Values

As innovators working towards new systems, it is critical for us to hold shared ethical principles with regards to the desired _output_ of our work. These system design ethics form a rubric for the collective evaluation of any civic system.

#### Vitality

The embodied state of _thriving_ that emerges from the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies.

#### Resilience

The state and the _capacity_ for adaptive self-organization sufficient to provide core life support function across changing world circumstances.

#### Choice

The state of respect for the sovereign _agency_ of all beings and the capacity of individual agents to participate and influence their circumstances.


## Principles

The qualities of the [third attractor](https://dodecahedron-stingray-np3t.squarespace.com/open-civic-innovation-framework#) that guide the innovation process, these design principles are essential for building robust, adaptable, scalable and equitable civic systems that can effectively serve diverse communities.

#### Modular

**Modular** refers to the design principle where a system is divided into separate, self-contained units or modules. Each module can function independently but can also be combined with other modules to create a more complex system. This approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance, as individual modules can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.

#### Composable

**Composable** refers to the capability of a system to be assembled from various components or modules in different configurations to meet specific needs. In the context of open civic systems, composability allows for the creation of tailored solutions by combining different modules, enabling adaptability and customization based on the unique requirements of different communities or projects.

#### Interoperable

**Interoperable** describes the ability of different systems, organizations, or components to work together seamlessly. In open civic systems, interoperability ensures that various modules or platforms can exchange information and function together effectively, regardless of their underlying technologies or architectures. This is crucial for creating cohesive and efficient civic solutions.

#### Inclusive

**Inclusive** means ensuring that the system is accessible and usable by all individuals, regardless of their background, abilities, or circumstances. In open civic systems, inclusivity involves designing with diverse user needs in mind, promoting equity, and ensuring that everyone can participate and benefit from the system. This includes considerations for accessibility, language, and cultural relevance.


[As fundamentally embodied social processes, empowering educational curricula are another key function within the dynamic constellation of the OpenCivics Framework. By aligning and tagging the plurality of processes developed by civic innovators around the world, curricula that utilize open protocols creates a feedback loop of education and empowerment. Through a decentralized and self-organizing process, curricula can be dynamically contributed to open protocol libraries to support the capacity building of community practitioners. Whereas the fundamental design primitives of the OpenCivics Innovation Framework are geared towards civic innovators developing open protocols, curricula and front-facing technological solutions are geared towards members of the public who wish to participate in civic stewardship in their communities.]
