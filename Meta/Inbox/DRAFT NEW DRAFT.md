As fundamentally embodied social processes, empowering educational curricula are another key function within the dynamic constellation of the OpenCivics Framework. By aligning and tagging the plurality of processes developed by civic innovators around the world, curricula that utilize open protocols creates a feedback loop of education and empowerment. Through a decentralized and self-organizing process, curricula can be dynamically contributed to open protocol libraries to support the capacity building of community practitioners. Whereas the fundamental design primitives of the _OpenCivics Innovation Framework_ are geared towards civic innovators developing open protocols, curricula and front-facing technological solutions are geared towards members of the public who wish to participate in civic stewardship in their communities.

The Open Civic Innovation Framework is a flexible, participatory infrastructure that guides the development, support, and governance of open civic systems. Built to enable modularity, adaptability, and collective agency, this framework provides a foundation for fostering civic innovation across communities and diverse social contexts. Its overarching goal is to empower civic actors, innovators, organizers, and patrons to create and sustain civic systems that support community well-being and ecological resilience.


- **Purpose**: To scaffold a new era of civic participation and innovation, the Framework creates a structured process for developing resilient, participatory civic systems, known as _open civic systems._ These systems align with decentralized protocols, helping communities fulfill their needs with minimal reliance on hierarchical structures.
  

### **2. Core Components of the Open Civic Innovation Framework**

**Open Civic Innovation Ecosystem**:
- **Purpose**: The ecosystem is the dynamic environment in which all civic innovation efforts unfold. It includes individuals, communities, and organizations interacting to develop shared knowledge, resources, and open civic systems.
- **Function**: The ecosystem serves as a relational “field of agreement” that brings together civic actors, fostering collaborative innovation, mutual support, and adaptability across diverse civic functions. It nurtures a cohesive yet flexible network of partnerships that drive transformative civic action.


**Open Civic Innovation Knowledge Commons**:

- **Purpose**: Acts as the core repository for shared knowledge, containing entries for resources, practices, and protocols that all participants can access, contribute to, and enhance.
- **Function**: Organized around four interconnected libraries — **Resources** (tools, patterns, protocols, writings), **Activities** (projects, alliances, grants, gatherings, courses), **People** (profiles and roles), and **Collections** (curated configurations of resources, activities, and people). The Knowledge Commons enables members to **discover**, **create**, **edit**, and **moderate** entries, fostering a collaborative space for resource sharing and open civic system design.


**Open Civic Innovation Process**:

- **Purpose**: Provides a structured approach for civic actors to align, coordinate, resource, and collaborate around civic initiatives.
- **Theory of Change**: Open Civic Innovation moves from institutionally-based civic functions to _protocolized_ civic systems, enabling communities to evolve beyond traditional governance by adopting adaptable and self-organizing protocols.
- **Stages**:
    1. **Align**: Establish shared patterns to unify the goals and intentions of diverse participants, forming the foundation for collective action.
    2. **Coordinate**: Facilitate structured, co-sensed interactions that help civic actors connect and organize without duplicating efforts. The **Alliances Program** supports co-sensing, collaboration, and cooperation on public goods initiatives.
    3. **Resource**: Address the often under-resourced nature of civic innovation through transparent, participatory funding mechanisms in the **Grants Program**. This program connects patrons with civic innovators and organizers.
    4. **Collaborate**: Support direct collaboration between civic actors through the **Initiatives Program**, promoting the co-development of civic utilities that are adaptable, scalable, and accessible.
    5. **Convene**: Organize regular gatherings through the **Gatherings Program** for members to connect, exchange ideas, and co-create solutions that strengthen community bonds.
    6. **Learn**: Emphasize mutual education through the **Academy Program**, enabling civic actors to develop their skills through an open, participatory learning environment.

**OpenCivics Network**:

- **Purpose**: A decentralized network that connects civic practitioners, funders, and stakeholders across local and global regions.

# Participation Levels

participation levels in the knowledge commons based on the roles you provided:

1. **Public**: The public engages with the knowledge commons by accessing the library, which is designed to function like an easy-to-navigate website or tool. This layer allows general users to discover and benefit from available resources, knowledge entries, and curated collections without needing deep technical or organizational knowledge.
    
2. **Practitioners**: These are active users who contribute to and maintain the knowledge commons. They access the backend of the knowledge commons, where they can create, edit, and moderate entries, propose new resources, and organize activities. Practitioners are directly involved in shaping the content and expanding the value of the knowledge commons for the entire ecosystem.
    
3. **Meta-Level Participants**: Operating at a governance level, meta participants engage in overseeing the structures and rules that define the knowledge commons. They participate in decision-making processes, setting standards, and evolving the governance framework itself. This group ensures the integrity, accessibility, and long-term sustainability of the knowledge commons through a stewardship approach.
