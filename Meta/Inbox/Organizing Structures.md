## Organizing Structures

The four organizing structures of OpenCivics, namely the Network, the Consortium, the Foundation, and the Labs, are each impacted differently by this progressive protocolization plan.

### The Consortium

The Consortium, being the primary operational container for OpenCivics programs, will be the focus of these protocolization efforts. The goal of this protocolization plan, as regards the Consortium, is to protocolize not only the various programs within the Consortium, but the formation and development of the Consortium itself. Programs, and projects within programs, will initially be centrally directed at the discretion of OpenCivics institutional leadership, and once these programs are proven effective in this manner, efforts will shift toward protocolizing the operations involved.

For example, the Grants Program, which contains grant rounds as distinct projects, has been piloted in a centralized manner, at the discretion of Consortium stewards. Now that we have managed three successful rounds in this manner, and have developed a familiarity with the operations involved, we are better positions to protocolize these operations. This specific protocolization would involve social and technical protocols, and be expressed by documentation around how Consortium members can use smart contracts to elect new round operators to run future grant rounds.

    - Create / Approve / Reject Proposals / **Maintain OpenCivics Framework**
    - Create / Approve / Reject Proposals / **Maintain Consortium Governance**

### The Foundation

The Foundation, which will be the primary funding source for programs in the Consortium, will oversee appropriations to these programs in compliance with nonprofit regulations and reporting requirements. The role which the Foundation plays can be protocolized as a template for how a community can form a foundation to seek charitable funding for its nonprofit purposes.

Seeing as the legal circumstances of the Foundation demand centralized accountability, we believe protocolization in this case will have to accommodate this legal and operational reality. While this organizing structure will, even at its mature state, involve a great degree of centralized institutional direction, the scope of this directorial discretion can still be well-defined and consent-based, and any protocolization of this structure will have to facilitate this definition and consent.

### The Labs

The Labs, like the Foundation, is a satellite structure to the Consortium, and will exercise some degree of autonomy, especially during its establishment and even at its maturity. The Labs will also enjoy a well-defined scope of institutional direction, seeing as its operations depend on the situational and nuanced dynamics of clientpartner relations. That said, the goal of protocolizing the Labs is to define a path for a community to commercially leverage their expertise as service providers, a business undertaking which is necessarily exclusive and centralized insofar as client acquisition and satisfaction demands high-signal communications and nimble operations.

### The Network

The Network, by definition the structure which least involves centralized institutional direction, will constitute at once the environment and beneficiary of the aforementioned protocolization efforts. In other words, as operations are successfully protocolized, and contributed to the wider knowledge commons, the Network will be the context in which these protocols are adopted and implemented as such.

For example, once the Grants Program is successfully protocolized, meaning once its procedures are comprehensively documented, any community in the Network will be able to access this documentation and initiate their own Grants Program, without as much of a sensemaking burden placed on that community’s discretionary leadership to bootstrap the requisite operations. In this respect, the discretionary institutional leadership stage of a particular program or project serves to learn the lessons which, once documented along the protocolization process, enables adopters of the protocol to manage operations in a more consent-driven manner.

### **2024 Plan & Retrospective (WIP)**

In January of 2024 the OpenCivics Network published our first [vision and strategic roadmap](https://opencivics.substack.com/p/2024-vision-and-strategic-roadmap). Within it, we detailed intentions for developing our “progressive decentralization roadmap”

> from phase one (driven by stewards) into phase two, a hybrid model that will increasingly empower decision making and coordination activities by the network.

Since that time, we have adapted our approach to reflect a “progressive protocolization roadmap” and have progressed in the following areas:

- […]

For the remainder of 2024 (Oct-Nov), our intention is to support:

- […]
- **NOTES (delete later)**
    - We will prototype our hybrid strategy for approximately one year, from 2024 to 2025, testing and iterating our hybrid strategy in real-world scenarios using a combination of **Hats Protocol, DeWork, and multi-signature** wallets to experiment with a combination of tools in smaller, focused contexts. We will also monitor and measure the performance and health of the network using various indicators and metrics before transitioning into full decentralization in phase three. Our initial experiments in the hybrid strategy will focus on **decentralizing our Grants Program** and **decentralizing a collaborative initiative focused on researching collaborative protocols**.
    - Over the course of the year, we’ll adapt our research on collaborative protocols into a white paper that will inform the full **socio-technical, on-chain implementation** of collaborative protocols.
