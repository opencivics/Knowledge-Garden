# Why A Model

A Theory of Change (ToC) serves as a foundational model that outlines the logic of the Network’s activities. At its core, OpenCivics’ ToC defines a long-term vision of a vital, resilient, and participatory civilization and then maps our work backward to identify the necessary preconditions that would give rise to that future systemic equilibrium.

These identified changes are graphically represented through causal pathways of outcomes, illustrating each outcome’s logical relationship to all others. This causal mapping represents a snapshot of what is ultimately an ongoing complex, adaptive, developmental and evolutionary process that will iteratively refine and develop as the network’s work unfolds, with updates being published on an annual basis.

As a “negative space organization,” the OpenCivics Network is committed to activities that empower self-organized coordination and non-rivalrous network effects through mutually beneficial infrastructures and collaborative frameworks rather than activities that impose prescriptive agendas beyond our personal and system ethics which we see as fundamental preconditions to any distributed, participatory process. By offering coordination infrastructure through a plurality of organizational forms and their activities, OpenCivics’ Theory Of Change revolves around creating the enabling conditions for a distributed civic renaissance of innovation, participation and stewardship.

## Strategic Pillars

While our vision statement represents the _what_ of our long term goals and our rubric for evaluating our outputs, our strategic pillars represent _how_ we get there. We hold these three pillars as practical considerations for how we engage in our Theory of Change.

**Modular** refers to the design principle where a system is divided into separate, self-contained units or modules. Each module can function independently but can also be combined with other modules to create a more complex system. This approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance, as individual modules can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.

**Composable** refers to the capability of a system to be assembled from various components or modules in different configurations to meet specific needs. In the context of open civic systems, composability allows for the creation of tailored solutions by combining different modules, enabling adaptability and customization based on the unique requirements of different communities or projects.

**Interoperable** describes the ability of different systems, organizations, or components to work together seamlessly. In open civic systems, interoperability ensures that various modules or platforms can exchange information and function together effectively, regardless of their underlying technologies or architectures. This is crucial for creating cohesive and efficient civic solutions.

**Inclusive** means ensuring that the system is accessible and usable by all individuals, regardless of their background, abilities, or circumstances. In open civic systems, inclusivity involves designing with diverse user needs in mind, promoting equity, and ensuring that everyone can participate and benefit from the system. This includes considerations for accessibility, language, and cultural relevance.

## Activities

OpenCivics' activities are strategic functions designed to provide the necessary scaffolding for the emergent self-organization of sovereign actors towards a common goal. These actions are distributed across the three organizational structures to create positive feedback loops between civic innovators, patrons, and community organizers.

- **Align**
    
    [...]
    
- **Coordinate**
    
    When and where our strategies _do_ align, it is critical to move as a coordinated body, avoiding duplication where possible, and informing other civic innovators how they can support a shared effort.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports coordination through our alliances program.
    
    We create a space for co-sensing, convergence, collaboration and cooperation on public goods and commons infrastructures. By providing scaffolding for facilitation, ephemeral self-organization, and an Open Protocol Library for the dynamic synthesis and distribution of civic innovations, OpenCivics attends to the force multiplying synergies between projects by supporting active collaboration and a high trust network of innovator peers.
    
- **Resource**
    
    Civic innovation, because of its non-extractive nature, is often under-resourced. We aim to change that.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports resourcing through our grants program.
    
    We work with funding partners to develop and deploy multiple participatory grant making mechanisms that provide mission-critical funding to underserved innovators and community organizers. From direct grants to quadratic funding rounds to streaming grants, we’re committed to serving as a bridge between civic patrons, innovators and organizers by coordinating impact reporting and attestation and by operating participatory processes that empower our members, funders, and the public to co-determine grant allocations through democratic and transparent mechanisms.
    
- **Collaborate**
    
    Beyond coordination, sometimes we need to create something specific together for mutual benefit. Collaboration is often essential when initiatives overlap and have common needs and goals.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports collaboration through our initatives program.
    
    We support collaborative initiatives that create research and development artifacts that serve the commons. These initiatives leverage the principles of modularity, interoperability, composability, and inclusivity to ensure that the resulting solutions are adaptable, scalable, and accessible to all. By fostering a participatory approach, we empowers communities to co-create and share knowledge, tools, and resources that address local and global challenges, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society.
    
- **Convene**
    
    Non-rivalrous relationships thrive on experiences of connection and cross-pollination. We convene change makers to strengthen our network by sharing physical and digital space.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports convening through our gatherings program.
    
    We support the organizing of inclusive events, workshops, and forums, that create spaces where community members, experts, and policymakers can share insights, co-create solutions, and build networks. These gatherings are intended to be accessible and engaging, strengthening community bonds, inspiring collective action, and driving meaningful change.
    
- **Learn**
    
    We’re at our best when we’re sharing our learning with one another; our experiences that empower others with knowledge, frameworks, and peer learning for collective action.
    
    The OpenCivics Network supports education through our academy program.
    
    Participatory learning enriches understanding, enhances capabilities, and strengthens communities. Peer learning builds trust, essential for overcoming challenges. This mutual sharing creates a growth cycle, highlighting diverse perspectives for impactful actions.
    
    In an effort to surface and amplify the rich content that exists abundantly within the civic innovation and adjacent fields, the program offers infrastructure to list existing course materials of multiple formats of learning in an open directory. We weave the work of network members into a distributed learning ecosystem for civic stewards to develop key capacities and to participate in co-development processes. This provides the an open, donation-based, project discovery dashboard for participatory learning.


Based on these activities, intermediate outcomes are the short term outputs of our primary forms of service. These near term outcomes are essential preconditions for the broader impacts we aspire to create. As these outcomes are demonstrated through our activities, our ToC provides a roadmap to stack our successes into larger scale systemic and civilizational impact.

- **Open Civic Culture**
    
    An open civic culture would demonstrate an ontological shift into a worldview of interbeing, an embodiment of Martin Luther King Jr’s Beloved Community. A critical precondition for a fully participatory, regenerative, and resilient civilization, this renewal of the social contract represents a key intermediate outcome for OpenCivics. By providing civic utilities that create a scaffold for this new and ancient worldview, we are supporting the development of a civic culture of participation and stewardship rooted in a shared sense of mutual belonging and responsibility for the wellbeing of our communities, commons, and ecologies.
    
- **Open Civic Protocols**
    
    As innovators align through open protocols, modular and interoperable civic utilities create a force multiplier for the rapid local adaptation of core civilizational systems. Local organizers are empowered to fork and merge open protocols while pushing their learnings and insights back into a global network, enabling a cosmo-local revolution in new forms of social organizing at the grassroots level. Templates, patterns, and civic stacks become easily discoverable and composable by community organizers as innovators work together to synthesize and interoperate their work.
    
- **Open Civic Utilities**
    
    As innovators receive funding and collaborate together on open protocols, capacity building utilities will be developed and distributed to the public who will then be empowered to refine and further co-develop them. Each of these tools will increase the public’s ability to self-organize around mutual needs and mutual benefits, supporting the competitiveness of non-enclosed and non-excludable infrastructures and to provide mechanisms for the public to opt out of dependencies on traditional corporate or governmental services into direct, participatory stewardship.


As the public becomes increasingly empowered and enculturated in the pro-social behaviors of a worldview of interbeing, higher level outcomes will begin to unfold as a natural consequence of the scaling and adoption of open civics systems.

- **Self-Governed Exitutions**
    
    When civic utilities are developed in communities around the world, they will begin to provide the same core services that traditional institutions once did. Driven by a renaissance in civic engagement, civic culture, and civic virtue, these new kinds of institutions will normalize the participatory stewardship of our communities and commons, eventually replacing legacy institutions as they proliferate, iterate, and develop their capacities.
    
- **Incentives Aligned With Wellbeing**
    
    Social organisms that proliferate as regenerative worker-owned cooperative businesses, combined with civic utilities that use open protocols to encode new value systems into infrastructures, will align the incentives of our economic and democratic systems with the will of the people and their care and consideration for the wellbeing of all Life. By binding our economic and governance processes within participatory and self-governed civic utilities and social organisms, mutual benefit, non-coercion, and holistic thriving will become the norm for our decision-making and revenue-generating activities.
    
- **Cosmo-Local Infrastructures**
    
    As civic utilities are developed – in some cases, utilizing the OpenCivics Innovation Framework– a lattice of interoperable civilizational public goods will create a basin of attraction for a parallel society. As these infrastructures stack and connect, a civic hyperstructure contributes towards a fully participatory, networked civilization that is grounded in civic stewardship and responsibility. As this lattice proliferates, the cosmo-local design pattern of hyper-local infrastructures that are intended to feed back into larger scales supports a post-nation state future emerging out of bioregional and watershed scales of self-organization.

## Vision

**We envision a human civilization that is participatory, vital, and resilient.**

We believe in a future in which humanity has successfully moved through our current evolutionary eye of the needle without destroying the substrate of living systems upon which we depend. In such a civilization, our civic systems – our culture, infrastructures, incentives, and institutions – are oriented towards life-affirming ways of being.

Our three pillars of civic innovation form a North Star that helps us to evaluate the systemic ethics and outcomes of our civic innovation and systems design. These pillars represent both a shared collective intent as well as a rubric for peer evaluation of our work towards these shared aims.

**Vitality** is the embodied state of _thriving_ that emerges from the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies.

**Choice** is the state of fundamental respect for the sovereign _agency_ of all beings and the capacity of individual agents to participate and influence their circumstances.

**Resilience** is the state and the _capacity_ for adaptive self-organization sufficient to provide core life support function across changing world circumstances.
