While many examples exist worldwide of communities self-organizing in this fashion, usually under the duress of immediate crisis or institutional collapse, the protocols utilized by those communities are often informal and rarely reproducible from movement to movement.

A very particular subset of the various types of innovation we can engage in as a species, civic innovations are mechanisms that support these self-organizing movements and local community organizing in a pluralistic structure that is more concerned with bottom up coordination than top down control.

The goal of the Open Civic Innovation Framework and the OpenCivics Network is to provision these mechanisms to the public in a structure that can be easily adapted, composed, and forked to meet the direct needs of local community organizers.

As a pattern language for open protocols, the Open Civic Innovation Framework offers a meta-pattern for these types of utilities, enabling them to be easily composed into civic stacks and supporting the alignment of civic innovators as they consider how their innovations might be networked and interoperated.

The OpenCivics Network is a decentralized solidarity network that includes patrons, innovators, and local community organizers in a participatory and non-rivalrous co-design process, supporting coordination, funding, and applied research into systemic interventions that support direct civic empowerment.

By holding the process of civilizational adaptation as a non-rivalrous network, the OpenCivics Network connects civic innovators, organizers, patrons and the public while also providing key coordination functions in the form of formalized templates for impact reporting and project interoperability.

If successful, the collective impact of the framework and network, as a convergence and coordination point for innovators and the public, will give rise to new, open civic systems, animated by a revitalized civic culture, able to produce a civilization that is vital, participatory, and resilient.
