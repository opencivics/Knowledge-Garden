> “We are going to have to find ways of organizing ourselves cooperatively, sanely, scientifically, harmonically and in regenerative spontaneity with the rest of humanity around the earth... We are not going to be able to operate our spaceship earth successfully nor for much longer unless we see it as a whole spaceship and our fate as common.”  — R. Buckminster Fuller

# ==1.0 Executive Summary==

## 1.1 Objective

[ READY ]

The OpenCivics Innovation Framework is a design methodology that supports the coordination of open civic innovation. As a minimum viable coordination infrastructure, the framework is designed to maximize the interoperability of civic utilities as well as to foreground a participatory, pluralistic and polycentric approach to creating civic systems. As such, the framework is an _infrastructural_ foundation upon which open civic systems can be built to meet adaptive local needs.

## 1.2 Core Concepts

- [...]
- [civic utilities = infrastructural components: community currency, mutual aid netwokr]

## 1.3 Audience

[ FOR REVIEW BL ]

This framework is designed to support civic innovators, organizers, and patrons seeking to engage with or develop participatory civic systems that prioritize local self-determination, vitality, and resilience.


# ==2.0 Background and Rationale==

## 2.1 Contextual Overview

[For writing, this should be concise list of contextual claims and link to thesis]

- In the context of collapse, meta-crisis or a rapidly changing world characterized by institutional distrust, the need for scalable and adaptable civic systems has never been greater. 
- Traditional, centralized governance models struggle to meet the diverse needs of modern [cosmolocal] communities.
- The Open Civic Innovation Framework supports civic stewards attempting to overcome this challenge by modeling local self-organization in the form of decentralized civic protocol systems or *open civic systems*, facilitating a shift from top-down institutional management to bottom-up civic empowerment.
- The thesis proposes that the emergent civic culture of the 21st century will be highly localized, process-oriented, and ecologically contextualized in response to an ethical and strategic necessity to orient humanity’s collective agency to defining, designing, and deploying civic systems that create the enabling conditions for the third attractor.

## 2.2 Problem Statement

[! Important, FOCUS HERE, SHORT]

Centralized civic institutions often lack the adaptability and responsiveness necessary for addressing complex local needs. This rigidity creates gaps in service and governance, hindering innovation and leaving communities vulnerable to social, economic, and environmental pressures.

## 2.3 Solution Statement

[! Important, FOCUS HERE, SHORT]

This framework envisions a cultural civic renaissance where communities are empowered to co-steward their own governance, resource management, and coordination through decentralized, participatory processes. These processes take form through modular, composable, interoperable, inclusive, *civic stacks* that are enlived into open civic systems through voluntary participation.

## 3.2 Meta-Model


The core innovation offered within the Open Civic Innovation Framework is a meta-model for composing civic systems.

As fundamentally embodied social processes, empowering educational curricula are another key function within the dynamic constellation of the OpenCivics Framework. By aligning and tagging the plurality of processes developed by civic innovators around the world, curricula that utilize open protocols creates a feedback loop of education and empowerment. Through a decentralized and self-organizing process, curricula can be dynamically contributed to open protocol libraries to support the capacity building of community practitioners. Whereas the fundamental design primitives of the _OpenCivics Innovation Framework_ are geared towards civic innovators developing open protocols, curricula and front-facing technological solutions are geared towards members of the public who wish to participate in civic stewardship in their communities.

## 5.1 Model

The Open Civic Innovation Framework's design philosophy can be best understood through our theory of change.

A Theory of Change (ToC) serves as a foundational *metamodel* that outlines the logic of the [network / Framework's] proposed methodology and activities. At its core, this ToC defines a long-term vision of a vital, resilient, and participatory civilization and then maps our work backward to identify the necessary preconditions that would give rise to that future systemic equilibrium.

These identified changes are graphically represented through causal pathways of outcomes, illustrating each outcome’s logical relationship to all others. This causal mapping represents a snapshot of what is ultimately an ongoing complex, adaptive, developmental and evolutionary process that will iteratively refine and develop as the network’s work unfolds, with updates being published on an annual basis.

[As a “negative space organization,” the OpenCivics Network is committed to activities that empower self-organized coordination and non-rivalrous network effects through mutually beneficial infrastructures and collaborative frameworks rather than activities that impose prescriptive agendas beyond our personal and system ethics which we see as fundamental preconditions to any distributed, participatory process. By offering coordination infrastructure through a plurality of organizational forms and their activities, OpenCivics’ Theory Of Change revolves around creating the enabling conditions for a distributed civic renaissance of innovation, participation and stewardship.]

## 5.2 Vision & Values

### Vision

**We envision a human civilization that is participatory, vital, and resilient.**

We believe in a future in which humanity has successfully moved through our current evolutionary eye of the needle without destroying the substrate of living systems upon which we depend. In such a civilization, our civic systems – our culture, infrastructures, incentives, and institutions – are oriented towards life-affirming ways of being.

Our three pillars of civic innovation form a North Star that helps us to evaluate the systemic ethics and outcomes of our civic innovation and systems design. These pillars represent both a shared collective intent as well as a rubric for peer evaluation of our work towards these shared aims.

**Vitality** is the embodied state of _thriving_ that emerges from the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies.

**Choice** is the state of fundamental respect for the sovereign _agency_ of all beings and the capacity of individual agents to participate and influence their circumstances.

**Resilience** is the state and the _capacity_ for adaptive self-organization sufficient to provide core life support function across changing world circumstances.

### Vitality

**Vitality** is Life’s capacity to create more Life, the embodied state of thriving that emerges from the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies.

Open civic systems foster a thriving state of well-being, derived from interconnected social, cultural, and ecological health. Rooted in indigenous principles like Sumak kawsay ("I am well because you are well"), vitality requires balancing quality of life for individuals and communities with ecological stewardship.

**Indicators**: Cultural diversity, community vitality, ecological resilience, and holistic well-being.

### Resilience

**Resilience** is the state of and the capacity for adaptive self-organization sufficient to provide core life-support function across changing world circumstances.

Designed to withstand and adapt to evolving challenges, resilient open civic systems exhibit decentralized structures that are modular and redundant. They can evolve without compromising the essential needs of participants.

**Indicators**: Diversity, redundancy, adaptive capacity, and interconnectivity.

### Choice

**Choice** is the state of fundamental respect for the sovereign agency of all beings and the capacity of individual agents to express their agency and influence their circumstances.

Upholding the agency and sovereignty of participants, choice empowers individuals to meaningfully engage, contribute, and adapt their involvement. Open civic systems respect autonomy, enabling participants to express their will and shape outcomes.

**Indicators**: Opt-in/out mechanisms, flexible participation, participatory decision-making, and conflict resolution.


## 5.3 Principles

While our vision statement represents the _what_ of our long term goals and our rubric for evaluating our outputs, our design principles represent _how_ we get there. We hold these four principles as practical considerations for how we engage in our Theory of Change.

### Modular

[Enables flexibility by allowing open civic systems to be customized and adapted to address specific local needs.]

**Modular** refers to the design principle where a system is divided into separate, self-contained units or modules. Each module can function independently but can also be combined with other modules to create a more complex system. This approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance, as individual modules can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.

### Interoperable

[Ensures open civic systems work together, enabling seamless collaboration and shared understanding across different communities and platforms.]

**Interoperable** describes the ability of different systems, organizations, or components to work together seamlessly. In open civic systems, interoperability ensures that various modules or platforms can exchange information and function together effectively, regardless of their underlying technologies or architectures. This is crucial for creating cohesive and efficient civic solutions.

### Composable

[Encourages combining and reconfiguring open civic systems into adaptable "civic stacks" based on specific community goals.]

**Composable** refers to the capability of a system to be assembled from various components or modules in different configurations to meet specific needs. In the context of open civic systems, composability allows for the creation of tailored solutions by combining different modules, enabling adaptability and customization based on the unique requirements of different communities or projects.

### Inclusive

[Emphasizes accessible and participatory structures that enable a wide range of community members to contribute and benefit from the ecosystem.]

**Inclusive** means ensuring that the system is accessible and usable by all individuals, regardless of their background, abilities, or circumstances. In open civic systems, inclusivity involves designing with diverse user needs in mind, promoting equity, and ensuring that everyone can participate and benefit from the system. This includes considerations for accessibility, language, and cultural relevance.


## 5.4 Activities

Activities are strategic functions designed to provide the necessary scaffolding for the emergent self-organization of sovereign actors towards a common goal. Engagement in these collaborative activities are intended to create positive feedback loops between civic innovators, patrons, and organizers.

#### Align

Establish shared patterns to unify the goals and intentions of diverse participants, forming the foundation for collective action.

#### Coordinate

Facilitate structured, co-sensed interactions that help civic actors connect and organize without duplicating efforts. The **Alliances Program** supports co-sensing, collaboration, and cooperation on public goods initiatives.

#### Resource

Address the often under-resourced nature of civic innovation through transparent, participatory funding mechanisms in the **Grants Program**. This program connects patrons with civic innovators and organizers.

#### Collaborate

Support direct collaboration between civic actors through the **Initiatives Program**, promoting the co-development of civic utilities that are adaptable, scalable, and accessible.

#### Convene
Organize regular gatherings through the **Gatherings Program** for members to connect, exchange ideas, and co-create solutions that strengthen community bonds.

#### Learn

Emphasize mutual education through the **Academy Program**, enabling civic actors to develop their skills through an open, participatory learning environment.


## 5.5 Outcomes

Based on these activities, intermediate outcomes are the short term outputs of our primary forms of service. These near term outcomes are essential preconditions for the broader impacts we aspire to create. As these outcomes are demonstrated through our activities, our ToC provides a roadmap to stack our successes into larger scale systemic and civilizational impact.

#### Open Civic Culture

An open civic culture would demonstrate an ontological shift into a worldview of interbeing, an embodiment of Martin Luther King Jr’s Beloved Community. A critical precondition for a fully participatory, regenerative, and resilient civilization, this renewal of the social contract represents a key intermediate outcome for OpenCivics. By providing civic utilities that create a scaffold for this new and ancient worldview, we are supporting the development of a civic culture of participation and stewardship rooted in a shared sense of mutual belonging and responsibility for the wellbeing of our communities, commons, and ecologies.

#### Open Civic Protocols

As innovators align through open protocols, modular and interoperable civic utilities create a force multiplier for the rapid local adaptation of core civilizational systems. Local organizers are empowered to fork and merge open protocols while pushing their learnings and insights back into a global network, enabling a cosmo-local revolution in new forms of social organizing at the grassroots level. Templates, patterns, and civic stacks become easily discoverable and composable by community organizers as innovators work together to synthesize and interoperate their work.

#### **Open Civic Utilities**

As innovators receive funding and collaborate together on open protocols, capacity building utilities will be developed and distributed to the public who will then be empowered to refine and further co-develop them. Each of these tools will increase the public’s ability to self-organize around mutual needs and mutual benefits, supporting the competitiveness of non-enclosed and non-excludable infrastructures and to provide mechanisms for the public to opt out of dependencies on traditional corporate or governmental services into direct, participatory stewardship.


## 5.6 Adaptations

[...]

#### Self-Governed Exitutions

When civic utilities are developed in communities around the world, they will begin to provide the same core services that traditional institutions once did. Driven by a renaissance in civic engagement, civic culture, and civic virtue, these new kinds of institutions will normalize the participatory stewardship of our communities and commons, eventually replacing legacy institutions as they proliferate, iterate, and develop their capacities.

#### Incentives Aligned With Wellbeing

Social organisms that proliferate as regenerative worker-owned cooperative businesses, combined with civic utilities that use open protocols to encode new value systems into infrastructures, will align the incentives of our economic and democratic systems with the will of the people and their care and consideration for the wellbeing of all Life. By binding our economic and governance processes within participatory and self-governed civic utilities and social organisms, mutual benefit, non-coercion, and holistic thriving will become the norm for our decision-making and revenue-generating activities.

#### Cosmo-Local Infrastructures
 
As civic utilities are developed – in some cases, utilizing the OpenCivics Innovation Framework– a lattice of interoperable civilizational public goods will create a basin of attraction for a parallel society. As these infrastructures stack and connect, a civic hyperstructure contributes towards a fully participatory, networked civilization that is grounded in civic stewardship and responsibility. As this lattice proliferates, the cosmo-local design pattern of hyper-local infrastructures that are intended to feed back into larger scales supports a post-nation state future emerging out of bioregional and watershed scales of self-organization.

## 6.3 Protocol Pattern Language


A protocol pattern language is [...]

### Social Organism Ontology

The social organism ontology proposes the following fundamental elements of **agency**, **membranes**, **roles**, **functions**, **flows,** and **culture**. 

Each element — **agency, membranes, functions, roles, flows, and culture** — represents a high-level recurring structure or behavior in the design and functioning of a social organism. These can be seen as **patterns** because they describe generalizable solutions to common challenges in building and sustaining social systems. Each of these can be broken down into **sub-patterns**.

[These object level primitives are intended to offer a composable pattern language for a diverse range of organism types that offer a diverse range of ecosystemic functions. Viewing social organisms as objects alone, however, negates the overarching ontological foundations of living systems principles, thus requiring the following living systems grammar to contextualize organisms as processes that are born, mature, evolve, decay, and offer their source materials back to the commons in the form of decomposition and systemic learning feedback loops.] 

[These ontological primitives are offered as a starting point for a collaborative process between civic innovators, organizers, and patrons to develop and deploy coordination systems that leverage this universal living systems language to provide foundations of interoperability and co-evolution. Taxonomic structures at the end of each element description offer an initial scaffolding structure for further socio-technical research and development.]

- **Agency**: Addresses the balance of individual and collective participation in a system.
  
- **Membranes**: Solve the challenge of defining boundaries and regulating flows between parts of a system.
  
- **Roles**: Provide a template for distributing responsibility and ensuring coordination.
  
- **Flows**: Describe how resources and information move through a system to maintain balance and functionality.
  
- **Culture**: Establishes coherence and sustainability through shared purpose, practices, and values.


#### Agency

Agency is the capacity of any individual, group, or entity to participate in systems through actions that influence the dynamics, structure, and functioning of the social organism and the ecology within which the social organism is situated. This includes their interactions, decision-making processes, and contributions to the collective behavior and outcomes of the organism. 

Agency can be held by **agents** or **agencies**.

Social organisms require a healthy balance of individual and collective agency. Defining clear bounds for the types of agency held by individual agents and collective agencies is essential for healthy relationships of flow and creativity. Holonic in nature, agents and agencies can be viewed as parts or as wholes depending upon the context of interpretation.

For example, we assume ourselves as individual humans to be agents but are in fact composed of multiple nested agents and agencies from cells to organ systems. One can view themselves as an agent so long as the subsystems are functioning in healthy patterns of flow. Similarly, agencies can be viewed as agents only when their subsystems are healthy and the social organism is exhibiting healthy patterns of flow.

As an elemental category, agency within an social organism encompass:

- **Agents:** individual actors who initiate actions, make decisions, hold roles and responsibilities, have needs and skills, and influence outcomes within the social [system|organism], contributing as a component part to a social organism’s overall adaptive and dynamic processes.

- **Agencies:** groups of agents that collectively initiate actions, influence outcomes, and produce outputs based utilizing participatory governance patterns to coordinate collective agency towards a mutually shared mission, vision, and purpose.

#### **Membranes**

Membranes are the boundaries that regulate and manage interactions, information flow, and resource exchange between actors in different parts of the social [organism|system]. These membranes maintain the integrity and coherence of distinct [parts|social units] while facilitating selective permeability for communication and collaboration, thereby supporting the organism's overall functionality and adaptability.

The membranes of a social organism encompass:

- **Nesting:** Membranes contain and are contained by other membranes. Internally, membranes refer to component parts within the social organism. Externally, membranes refer to the nested holons within which the membrane is located.
    
- **Peer Relations:** Membranes also define the lateral relationships within peer groups. These relationships, internal or external, reference the flows across parts and wholes.
    
- **Threshold Conditions:** Semipermeable membranes maintain structural integrity by determining what types of agency and flows are permitted to cross into the social organism. Clearly defined membranes support healthy reciprocal flows.
    
- **Taxonomic Structure**

        - Flow Conditions
            - Qualitative Conditions
            - Quantitative Conditions

#### **Functions**

Functions are the essential actions performed by actors that contribute to the maintenance, growth, and adaptation of the social [organism|system]. These functions are vital for achieving the organism's objectives, ensuring its stability, and enabling its response to internal and external changes. Social organism functions are based on the OODA Loop model, a simple feedback loop that helps a social organism observe the challenge it is attempting to address in its environment through collective sensemaking, orient its strategy through a comprehensive mapping of relevant systems components, make collective decisions relevant to coordination and shared agency, and take action through resource allocation and coordination. As the social organism runs through this feedback loop throughout its lifecycle, it is critical to integrate the ongoing learnings into adaptive, iterative improvements.

The functions of a social organism encompass:

- **Sense-making:** The process of interpreting and understanding complex information to create a shared perspective and meaning within a social organism.
    
- **Mapping:** The identification and visualization of the relationships, structures, and dynamics to better understand components of a holistic system and their interactions.
    
- **Decision Making:** The evaluation of options and selection of courses of action to guide the social organism toward its goals.
    
- **Allocating:** The distribution of resources and roles to optimize [the social organism's] functioning.
    
- **Coordinating:** The synchronization and alignment of activities, processes, and efforts among different parts of the social organism to ensure effective collaboration and efficiency.
    
- **Learning:** The acquisition, assimilation, and application of insights to improve the social organism's adaptability, resilience, and functioning.

        - Signaling & Communication Flows
        - Collaborative Processes
    - Learning / educate
        - Surveying
        - Analyzing

#### **Roles**

Roles are the the specific functions, responsibilities, and behaviors assigned to or adopted by actors within the social [organism|system]. These roles guide interactions, contribute to the distribution of activities, and shape the collective purpose of the organism, enabling effective coordination towards shared goals. Roles define the scope of individual agency, where consensus is needed vs where individual agency is collectively supported, and which agents are responsible for stewarding which flows and functions. Roles can be nested into membranes if the scope of the role expands beyond the capacity of a single agent.

The roles of a social organism encompass:

- **Role Type:** Role types may include standard functions or customized functions. Social organisms may set as a membrane condition that each membrane contains a certain number of specific role types (ie facilitators or knowledge managers) for the healthy functioning of that membrane.
    
- **Role Description:** Role descriptions are summaries of responsibilities and permissions for each role. Written in natural language, they are effectively a mission, vision, and purpose statement for each agent or agency within a social organism. These statements provide a baseline rubric for the evaluation of the role filler’s functions.
    
- **Role Responsibilities:** Responsibilities are specific functions that a role filler fulfills through their agency.
    
- **Role Permissions:** Permissions define the scope of agency for each role. Permissions may address various contexts of agency with the goal of clearly defined boundaries between collective agency and individual empowerment.
    
- **Taxonomic Structure**
    
    - Role Type
        - Facilitation
        - Communication

    - Role Description
    - Role Responsibilities
        - Functions
        - Flows
    - Role Permissions
        - Domains of Agency

#### **Flows**

Flows are the movement and exchange of information, resources, and energy across the membranes between actors within the social organism and social ecology. These flows facilitate communication, collaboration, cooperation, and coordination, ensuring the continuous functioning and adaptability of the organism by enabling the distribution and integration of essential elements needed for its [flourishing|survival and development]. Value flows denote the inflows of various forms of capital, the transformation of those inflows into outflows, and the value added through the transformation process. Flows can be understood through the MetaIntegral multi-capital framework which describes ten distinct forms of capital whose healthy flows are necessary for a social organism.

These forms of capital include:

- **Financial Capital**: This is the most familiar form of capital. It includes money, investments, and financial assets. Financial capital enables economic transactions and investment in other forms of capital.
- **Human Capital**: Human capital encompasses the skills, knowledge, and abilities possessed by individuals. Education, training, experience, and health contribute to human capital. It represents an individual’s capacity to create value.
- **Social Capital**: Social capital relates to social connections, networks, and relationships. Trust, cooperation, and community bonds fall under this category. Social capital facilitates collaboration and collective action.
- **Natural Capital**: Natural capital refers to Earth’s natural resources and ecosystems. It includes forests, water bodies, minerals, and biodiversity. Proper management of natural capital is essential for sustainability.
- **Manufactured Capital**: This type of capital comprises non-living physical objects. It includes infrastructure, buildings, machinery, and technology. Manufactured capital supports economic activities.
- **Cultural Capital**: Cultural capital encompasses shared beliefs, traditions, and cultural heritage. It includes art, music, language, and cultural practices. Cultural capital contributes to identity and social cohesion.
- **Knowledge Capital**: Knowledge capital represents intellectual resources. It includes information, expertise, innovation, and intellectual property. Knowledge capital drives progress and development.
- **Health Capital**: Health capital refers to physical well-being and health. It includes nutrition, exercise, and overall health. Good health contributes to productivity and quality of life.
- **Psychological Capital**: Psychological capital focuses on mental and emotional well-being. Resilience, optimism, and self-confidence fall under this category. Psychological capital influences personal success.
- **Spiritual Capital**: Spiritual capital encompasses inner values, purpose, and meaning. It relates to our spiritual beliefs and connection to something greater than ourselves.

These forms of capital interact and influence each other. Recognizing and balancing them is crucial for sustainable development and holistic well-being.

The flows of a social organism encompass:

- **Inputs:** Inputs are the [information, resources, and energy | resources, information, energy, and stimuli] that are introduced into the social [system | organism]. These inputs are essential for [initiating processes, driving activities, and enabling interactions] that sustain and develop the organism's [functions and goals].
    
- **Outputs:** Outputs are the tangible and intangible results produced by the activities, processes, and interactions within the social [ system | organism ]. These outputs include [products, services, knowledge, decisions, and actions] that contribute to the organism's [goals, enhance its functioning, and influence its environment].
    
- **Value Accounting:** Value accounting is the systematic tracking, measuring, and evaluating of [contributions, resources, and benefits] within the social [system | organism]. This process ensures that the value created [by individuals and groups] is [recognized, quantified, and fairly distributed], fostering [transparency, equity, and mutual support] among the participants in the organism.

    - Value Accounting
        - **Agent**
        - **Task**
        - **Evaluation**

#### **Culture**

The culture of a social organism is both its internal set of agreements, rituals, and behavioral practices as well as its overall expression of the collective sense of purpose, mission, and vision of its members. Establishing a core Cultural DNA at the center of every membrane is essential to cohere and sustain a social organism’s longevity through its lifecycle. This core DNA should establish the fundamental relational agreements between participants and provide means of restorative justice when interpersonal or mission-related ruptures occur.

The culture of a social organism encompass:

- **Vision, Mission, and Purpose:** By providing a guiding north star for the collective agency of the social organism, it is clear to participants why they may want or not want to align through collective agency. While approaches may differ throughout the maturation of the social organism, a shared sense of the organism’s ultimate purpose provides an evaluative mechanism for the organism to reflect upon its own successes or failures.

- **Values:** Values are effectively priorities that further help to guide the process and outputs of a social organism. Whereas the mission and purpose of the organism describe the desired outcomes, values further identify the qualities of the process and outcome that participants desire.

- **Practices and Rituals:** Practices and rituals are social mechanisms for establishing and maintaining group coherence or to support restorative processes when ruptures occur. Ranging from daily group practices like brief meditations or check ins to quarterly in-person retreats or ceremonies, group practices are essential to ensure the social organism’s culture is intact and effective.

- **Agreements:** Agreements refer to a broad range of different types of social constructs related to the relational qualities of the social organism. Agreements can establish mutually determined behavioral norms, participatory processes, or communication patterns.

- **Taxonomic Structure:**

    - Vision, Mission, and Purpose
        - Theory Of Change
        - Purpose Statement
    - Values
        - Process Values
        - Outcomes Values
    - Practices & Rituals

        - Co-Creative Practices
    - Agreements
        - Behavioral Agreements
        - Process Agreements
        - Communication Agreements

### Living Systems Grammar

The fundamental ontology of a social organism is composed through the syntax or logic of living systems grammar. Like all organisms, social organisms have a life cycle where they are conceived, develop, mature and evolve, before decomposing and reconstituting again in an evolutionary feedback loop. Considerations regarding each of the ontological elements will be unique at each stage in the social organism’s life cycle, but holistic consideration of each element at each stage of development is necessary. Additionally, the relational contexts provided by the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab offer critical relational lenses that are crucial throughout the lifecycle as mechanisms to understand the nested and interpenetrating relationships that inform the internal and external contexts of a social organism.

The purpose of this living systems grammar is to clearly define the underlying processes that make an organism truly _alive_. While there are several academic approaches to living systems theory, commonalities between all of them are autopoiesis, negentropic metabolic processes, self-repair, and reproduction. Autopoesis implies that they are “self-creating” in the sense that they exhibit a form of collective agency that perpetually recreates and reaffirms its own existence. Negentropic metabolic processes imply that they consume resources and transform those resources into coherent outputs. Self-repair and reproduction imply that they are able to dynamically relate to their environment to respond to injury and are able to continue their lineage by engaging in proactive reproduction. These organismic processes occur throughout the lifecycle of a social organism as it forms, contributes to its ecology, and dies.

The decomposition and reconstitution of social organisms is an important distinction between social organisms and traditional institutions. Akin to Thomas Jefferson’s precinct warnings during the founding of the United States of America, “the earth belongs to the living.”

> “Between society and society, or generation and generation there is… no umpire but the law of nature. We seem not to have perceived that, by the law of nature, one generation is to another as one independent nation to another… On similar ground it may be proved that no society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation… Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force and not of right.” – **Thomas Jefferson**

As truly living organisms, composed of human agents just as organs are composed of cells, social organisms play a role in their ecological context, make certain contributions to the overall vitality of their environment, and decompose to offer their learnings and component parts as evolutionary inputs to the next generation of social organisms.

The processes defined below are intended to provide an initial scaffolding for the complex interactions and relationships that occur within and between living systems. Further inputs from traditional indigenous wisdom sources as well as ecologists and social scientists is needed.

#### **Conception**

Conception is the initial phase of generating and formulating new ideas, visions, or plans. This stage emanates from the felt sensing of an individual or group of agents related to a critical social need. This inspiration may take the form of a key insight to a missing social service or function or a curiosity around an alternative method for improving the provisioning of that core civilizational need. At the conception stage of a social organism’s lifecycle, individual agents are responsible for instigating the seed of a social organism’s DNA, the underlying framework of mission, vision, and values as well as an initial set of cultural agreements. While these patterns will likely evolve as the organism forms and develops, they represent the first membrane of the social organism and provide a participatory pathway for agents to consensually cross the threshold if they align with the initial vision and wish to step forward to help shape its further development and maturation.

#### **Gestation**

Gestation is the period during which ideas, plans, or initiatives are developed, refined, and prepared for implementation. This stage involves nurturing, organizing, and iterating on the initial concept, ensuring it matures and evolves into a viable and actionable form that can contribute effectively to the social ecology. The gestation process involves further sense-making and mapping of community needs, testing the hypothesis of the initial conception period, and developing the internal membranes, roles, and flows necessary for the organism to begin to fulfill its ecological purpose. As roles are defined and additional agents are included in the development process, governance mechanisms are needed to support initial decision making processes and establish the nested functions and flows that will support the organism in achieving its purpose as it matures.

#### **Maturation**

Maturation is the phase of development in which the social organism is fully fulfilling its ecological purpose. In this stage, internal membranes, roles, functions, culture and flows are well established and can begin generating value as an output to their ecology. Arriving at a state of maturity, the organism is effectively able to metabolize inputs into outputs while nourishing and sustaining itself. While this stage is primarily defined by the contribution the organism is making to its ecology, it is also an important phase for internal development, mutually reinforcing behavioral and cultural patterns and processes, as well as the internal flows of information and resources between the internal functional membranes. A mature organism also begins to consider its own reproduction and begin the transition process into a rising generation of emerging leaders. The maturation process can

#### **Decomposition**

Once the social organism has reached the peak of its maturity, it begins the process of decomposition and death. This phase of the lifecycle is focused on integrating the evolutionary learnings of the dying generation into the core DNA of the rising one. The decomposition process includes contributing the constituent parts of the organism back to the commons where they can be re-composed into new life as well as the evolutionary process of maintaining whatever aspect of the organism’s iterative experimentation was life-affirming. This process of natural selection, applied to social organisms, supports the ongoing evolutionary feedback process of iterative development, improvement, and refinement.

## 7.1 Getting Started Guide

[ WIP ]

A practical guide to adopting and implementing the Open Civic Innovation Framework [within communities].

- **Step 1**: Define community goals and immediate needs.
- **Step 2**: Select relevant protocols and processes to match these needs.
- **Step 3**: Engage community members in introductory sessions.

- **Onboarding & Getting Started**: Provide instructions for individuals or groups new to the framework, guiding them through initial steps for engagement, selecting protocols, and finding resources.
- **Guidelines for Self-Organization**: Include best practices for groups as they move from centralized coordination to more autonomous, protocolized structures.
- **Resource Exchange and CoLab Engagement**: Outline pathways for resource exchange, how to engage in CoLabs, and ways to leverage network support for collaborative projects.
- **Assessment and Metrics**: Introduce tools for measuring success and growth based on your metrics: simplicity (cognitive load), resonance (emotional impact), and participation (agent-centricity).

- **Pattern Formation**: The innovation process begins with an initial pattern formation, shaped by dialogue, provocation, and invitation. This dialogic process becomes the spark for aligning intentions and catalyzing action, moving from articulation to alignment, collaboration, and iteration.
- **Bespoke Design Integration**: The ecosystem incorporates customizable design parameters, supporting communities in tailoring open civic systems that meet their unique needs within a shared framework.
- **Modular Civic Stack Templates**: Provides examples and templates for civic systems (e.g., tool libraries, housing co-ops), showing how communities can customize and adapt the framework locally.

# TO INTEGRATE

This “third horizon” thinking is pre-figurative and imaginal while remaining pragmatic and grounded. It opens a design space in which the next epoch of open civic systems may be explored and co-evolved through bottom-up, participatory means.

The framework scaffolds/represents a modular, interoperable, composable, and inclusive approach to civic innovation that models civic systems off of the development of open source software, stigmergic living systems patterns, open standards bodies, the symbiotic intelligence of an artistic or cultural scene, and commons self-governance principles.

This approach builds towards the innovation of civic systems as open protocols; open civic systems. A meta-protocol for composing civic systems as social organisms is offered as a pattern language that enables a participatory, pluralistic and polycentric approach. Effectively, this is an open protocol for producing open protocols.

Thus, this thesis attempts to offer a sketch of an underlying grammar [and/or syntax | logic] for distributed coordination, ie an open civics. This grammar proposes an underlying schema for self-organizing processes and resilient, place-based and cosmo-local infrastructures that provide the enabling conditions for a fundamentally post-capitalist and even post-nation state human civilization.

By providing an initial schema that correlates the fundamental categories, functions, and processes of distributed coordination, this thesis outlines both the core functions of OpenCivics Network as a set of mechanisms as well as a coherent, overarching framework for a fully participatory process of civilizational adaptation.

By linking the many commons and peer to peer efforts to revitalize the civic design space, this ontological framework provides a foundation for a fully distributed process, governed by those who engage in it. This model is not intended to be complete or final in any sense, rather it offers a schelling point, a point of convergence and underlying schema to coordinate the process of systemic adaptation and co-evo_lution._

As such, this model is intended to be co-evolved through participatory stewardship. Instead of proposing this framework as definitive or absolute, this thesis approaches design process as a necessary **minimum viable coordination mechanism** and continuously evolving scaffolding in support of the emergence and co-creation of interoperable, modular, and participatory open protocols.

Embracing the ontological shift into a worldview of interbeing, core societal functions are reframed as nested wholes that provide mutually reinforcing, cascading benefits for the social ecology within which they participate. By reimagining society’s infrastructures, incentives, and institutions through a fundamentally living systems lens, this framework is intended to support a broad societal shift into an ecological understanding of right relationship, reciprocity, and flow. Composing civic utilities in this context, the emergent social organisms that unfold are structured in a universal language of Life that supports the interoperable continuity, holonic nesting, and stigmergic coordination of human societal functions.

As an alignment and coordination strategy, composing social organisms utilizing this framework supports a commons process of participatory feedback and learning, allowing social organisms to evolve organically through a cosmo-local process of experimentation, iteration, and co-creation.

Civic utilities or civic stacks are composed of the fundamental building blocks or elements of social organisms that are fractal in nature and contain various self-referencing components that can be stacked and composed into living processes.
