While our commons and ecologies have been ravaged by extractive industries, so too has our [social fabric](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/). Accelerated by the [attention economy](https://www.humanetech.com/youth/the-attention-economy) and the [influence of social media algorithms](https://hls.harvard.edu/today/the-algorithm-has-primacy-over-media-over-each-of-us-and-it-controls-what-we-do/#:~:text=As%20ethicist%20Tristan%20Harris%20argued,it%20controls%20what%20we%20do.%E2%80%9D), humanity has been pitted against itself at a time when global solidarity is more needed than ever.

Regenerating the social fabric requires a fundamental shift in power dynamics, moving from rivalrous institutions and incentives, towards a pluralistic, polycentric, and prosocial approach to large-scale coordination.

Essential to this process is the concept of imagination activism, coined by the European research and practice centre [Moral Imaginations](https://www.moralimaginations.com/), which brings community members together to discover and build upon shared alignment instead of arguing over differences.

This bottom up approach to consensus building and direct collective action brings us out of our filter bubbles into immanent and embodied relationships with the humans and non-humans with whom we share our physical home.

Reliably, when we return to the common ground of shared being and belonging, our attention is directed towards creating safe places for our children and future generations, valuing intact ecologies that support essential ecosystem services, and recognizing the human need for connection, dignity, and purpose.

A key example of this material solidarity is the phenomenon of water stewardship. Across all of our ideological silos and bubbles, our material survival is inextricably rooted in our access to and the quality of our water. Weaving together farmers, residents, hunters, ecologists, indigenous first nations and others, we are compelled by our mutual reliance on clean water to protect and steward water as a sacred civic resource. These areas of mutual alignment are often overlooked within rivalrous social, economic, and political systems because they do not generate the requisite outrage and division upon which those systems thrive.

Therefore, regenerating our ecologies, communities, and commons becomes part of the same regenerative return towards the renewal and revitalization of local stewardship and direct civic responsibility for the systems that shape our well-being.
