This expression of civic culture and cosmo-local orientation to stewardship defies the internal logic of the divide and conquer strategies deployed by our rivalrous political factions, invoking a new kind of transpolitical solidarity that is more concerned with quality of life and pluralistic, bottom-up positive sum collaboration.

By embracing a philosophy of pluralism and agent-centricity, we transcend and integrate the best of many different political philosophies as we coordinate at the local level to improve quality of life.

Divisive political ideologies become less relevant in this context as we are focused on the material conditions of our lives and are less concerned with the regulatory state and its top down restrictions or incentives.

Instead of competing to control the stateâ€™s violent apparatus, communities can engage in a process of discovery that foregrounds shared alignment and emphasizes creativity and experimentation.

Such a process is measured by the intersubjective metrics of quality of life, determined based on the needs and perspectives of each individual and thus dependent upon a diversity of strategies to improve quality of life from the ground up.
