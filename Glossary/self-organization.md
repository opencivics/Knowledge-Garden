*A process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system. Sometimes referred to as spontaneous order in the social sciences.*

*A process where a system spontaneously forms an organized structure or pattern without external control. This phenomenon occurs through local interactions among the system’s components, often driven by feedback mechanisms. Self-organization is observed in various fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and social sciences. Examples include the formation of snowflakes, flocking behavior in birds, and the emergence of market dynamics.*
