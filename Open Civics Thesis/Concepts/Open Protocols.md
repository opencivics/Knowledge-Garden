Protocols serve as detailed guidelines or frameworks that outline specific steps to be followed to achieve desired outcomes. Open protocols are specific types of public goods that establish infrastructure for open civic systems.

Protocols usually include:

- **Objective:** The purpose and goal of the protocol
- **Scope**: What's included and excluded in the protocol
- **Procedures**: Step by step instructions to achieve the objective
- **Roles and responsibilities:** Who is responsible for each action within the procedures
- **Materials and equipment:** What’s required to carry out the procedures
- **Guidelines:** Suggested considerations while conducting procedures
- **Documentation:** Suggestions on how to document the outcomes of the procedures

Open protocols are a subset of protocols that are openly documented and freely available for anyone to use, implement, and modify. They are developed and maintained through collaborative, transparent processes, often involving multiple stakeholders.

In the case of the OpenCivics Innovation Framework, open protocols are documented and made available through the knowledge commons, and most specifically, a subset of the commons which acts as an “open protocol library”.

### **Open Protocol Strategy**

Open protocols can be generally understood as recipes, templates, or DNA packets for social organisms. By describing the formal and informal processes for different types of social organisms, these protocols support the propagation and experimentation of new civic utilities that operate according to living systems principles.

Unlike official legal or institutional protocols which operate as standardized and prescriptive rules, open protocols are formalized through extitutional groups who adopt them as guiding principles and scaffolding for emergent self-organization. Open protocols are designed to proliferate based on their _utility_, evaluated by their capacity to provide improved quality of life for humans and the living world. Their adoption is inherently voluntary, experimental, and iterative, with each group’s implementation of a given protocol contributing to its ongoing refinement and development.

Protocols allow for coherent self-organization by making the parameters of governance, contribution, and attribution transparent, co-stewarded, and clear by formalizing relationships of flow without the need for centralized control. Stigmergic coordination is supported by protocolization that clearly defines how autonomous actions can synergize as part of a broader organismic effort.

Utilizing the OpenCivics Innovation Framework as a meta-protocol, open protocols can be easily documented in a modular fashion, supporting remixing, local adaption, and decentralized research. Technologists and community organizers can leverage the power of this universal pattern language to promote the increased functionality and utility of technologies and community efforts by linking them with a broader, decentralized, open source social systems design community. Linked knowledge databases of open protocols, ideally federated and interoperable with one another themselves, provide a public good that empowers direct action and collective stewardship of our communities and commons. Eventually leveraged as training data for customized Large Language Models, Artificial Intelligence assistants will be able to support community members and organizers to discover, learn about, and deploy open protocols in their communities.

Open protocols are a critical evolution of the work of Elinor Ostrom whose principles of commons governance define many of the key considerations of open protocol designers and community practitioners. By evolving the work of commons governance into a socio-technical engineering stack for the public itself, investment in the work to develop open protocols serves to effectively “compost capital” by generating self-sustaining, post-capitalist, local resilience and self-determination. Orienting the broad and multi-disciplinary fields of all pro-social impact entrepreneurship around the development process of open protocol development in turn will catalyze a massively disruptive and rapid phase transition in humanity’s collective and collaborative capacity to address fundamental, systemic, and existential crises we face as a species. Only through a renewed culture of civic engagement, combined with the tools of open protocols for civic utilities, can a fully stigmergic and decentralized coordination response to our present crises occur.

Further distributed research is needed to collate existing and novel approaches to each of the specific components of open protocols. Many bodies of work, ranging from formally defined processes like ProSocial.world, Theory U, Warm Data Labs and Sociocracy to entire fields of research in knowledge ecology, value accounting, governance, currency design, systems mapping, and blockchain DAO smart contracts are necessary to fully document and structure the diverse scope of component functions of open protocols. The OpenCivics Innovation Framework attempts to generate a “schelling point” or basin of attraction for the coordination of the development of open protocols by offering an overarching structure by which the component parts of open protocols can be categorized and referenced. Mechanisms to facilitate this process are described in detail in the final section of this thesis.

### **The Nature Of Protocols | The Protocols Of Nature**

It's first important to distinguish between the contemporary technological connotation of the term protocol and the biocultural and socio-technical context in which it is utilized in this thesis. Similarly, open protocols are a new body of research and applied knowledge that further shift how protocols are perceived and interacted with. Put together, the framing of open protocols presented in this thesis refer to adaptive, contextual, and consent-based patterns of interaction that support sovereign and interdependent social interactions.

Throughout living systems and indigenous cultures, protocols are an underlying pattern language of interaction that produce flows of reciprocity and right relationship. In indigenous cultures, protocol is often utilized to refer to the practices and procedures of ceremony and ritual interactions. These protocols are not abstract or performative in the sense that they have emerged organically from thousands of years of high context cultures. Within high context cultures, relationships are mediated through a greater depth of embeddedness within our ecologies and social relationships, contrasted by low context cultures in which monolithic patterns are imposed on a variety of circumstances across diverse contexts. In the indigenous sense, protocols are patterns of interaction that produce intact relational fields.

Within a living systems context, protocols can be understood as the pattern languages utilized by plant and animal life to produce emergent structures through stigmergic coordination. In the context of many insects, a simple protocol pattern language composed of pheromone signals produces patterns of interaction that stack the contributions of each individual into a swarm intelligence that produces a whole greater than the sum of its parts.

Unlike traditional institutions, extitutions are the product of open protocols, patterns of interaction that are adopted through consent and can be modified, forked, and composed according to the agency of participants. For this reason, this thesis proposes a framework for open protocols in an effort to model a global human civilization on the stigmergic qualities of living systems protocols and the relational coherence of indigenous ones. The complexity and comprehensivity of the meta-crisis necessitates a complex adaptive system of interoperable and composable solutions that recenter the sovereignty of individuals and communities to directly address the challenges they face. The intended outcome of aligning innovators through a framework for open protocols modeled on living systems principles is nothing less than a stigmergic, self-organized process of cosmo-local adaptation and planetary learning process regarding protocolized local approaches to solving deeply entrenched challenges.
