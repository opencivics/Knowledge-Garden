Civic stacks templates that support the composition of civic utilities into open protocols. Civic utilities are essential infrastructure that support the functioning of civic systems.

Civic stacks are compositions of open protocols that provide core civilizational functions through minimum input of capital by maximally unlocking the latent collective action potential of a group of humans. Applied as adaptive social organisms, the actualization of these civic stacks serves as a participatory feedback loop for the further development and refinement of open protocols. Because they are composed of the same underlying ontology, grammar, and protocols, the public is easily able to discover, apply, modify and fork the stack for their own purposes. As the public engages in this participatory process, the stacks and their component elements will co-evolve. Civic stacks are most easily conceived at the local level, but further research is required to ascertain their viability for larger scale civic systems like energy or information infrastructure. Below is a series of examples to illustrate the vast potential application of civic stacks as recipes for particular forms of civic stewardship and engagement.

To better illustrate how open protocols can be composed as social organisms to deliver key civic utilities, each ontological element is referenced below in the context of each phase of the social organism’s life cycle. Here, we can see a set of generalizable self-organization patterns that naturally occur as social organisms form, gestate, mature, and decompose. While these patterns will be distinct in their specific open protocol contexts, each [element and developmental process contain key insights, capacities, and sequences of activities] that support the social organism in developing into its potential as a civic utility. Civic utilities that reach the maturation stage of the social organism’s lifecycle will be able to offer core civilizational needs through the participatory and self-governed application of protocols.

The OpenCivics Innovation Framework offers a meta-pattern for open civic utilities, enabling them to be easily composed into civic stacks and supporting the alignment of civic innovators as they consider how their innovations might be networked and interoperable.

Civic stacks are meant to be utilized and adapted based on the needs of the instance. They are tagged with relevant data through bidirectional links – like civic sectors, experiments (of origin), locations and general tags. They are intended as a template for customization.

### **Civic Stack Template**

Civic stacks are composed as tables, where the y axis is the components of the system and the x axis is the developmental phases of the system (as an organism). In the intersectional space, protocols can be associated (through bidirectional linking) with protocols that are most useful related to particular considerations within a system at particular developmental phases. These protocols detail inputs and outputs that are best oriented towards surfacing agreements or “common ground” from participants of the process.

Tables can be incomplete and are intended to convey “best practices” as was known or utilized by others in their particular instance of deployment.

[ Contributor Note – there is an active discussion about how to approach what a civic stack is. Initial thinking is that it’s a page format which includes some sense of model that supports sensemaking. Below is an example of two different approaches, please contribute and expand as you wish! ]

The object template of a “civic stack” within the knowledge commons can be accompanied by any additional information that is deemed useful. For example, copies of the specific outputs/agreements of the protocols included may be included, as may mention of practitioners who offer support to those implementing the civic stack.

### **Examples Civic Stacks**

- **Housing Cooperative**
    
    By forming a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to govern and tokenize the purchase of multi-family dwellings (apartment building, duplex, large community home, etc), participants gain the capacity to develop equity in their own home while retaining the flexibility to sell the equity they’ve developed should they decide to move out. Merging alternative methods of governance, legal instrumentation, and ownership models, this civic stack leverages collective agency to push back on the extractive and exclusionary practices of large corporate real estate interests.

- **Community Wellness Cooperative**
    
    Coordinating the knowledge and physical capital of traditional medicines that can be grown or foraged around your community, community wellness cooperatives or mutual aid organizations are able to provide holistic preventative medicines to participants who collectively grow, process, and educate their neighbors on the use of local medicinal plants and practices. Imagine growing a small section of medicinal herbs in your garden and bringing your harvest several times per year to a community gathering with a large kitchen space in which the community collectively processes the herbs into tinctures and dried blends that are then shared with the entire community, combining education, empowerment, and collective action.

- **Food System Localization**
    
    Facilitating collective relationships between regenerative farmers, local restaurants, farmers markets, and community supported agriculture programs, community members can increase the volume of food produced locally in their area. By forming new coalitions between existing producers and consumers, facilitated by a community currency or other method of incentive, community members can improve local resilience, generate collective power to advocate for regenerative land use policies, and increase their intimacy with those who grow their food.

- **Child and Elder Care**
    
    Both elders and children are often neglected in a hyper-capitalist society. By matching caregivers with those in need of care, an open platform for different modes of decommercialized care can facilitate greater provision of inclusive and post-capitalist caregiving services. Motivated by a culture of civic service, these new pathways for caregiving provide a key social function by directly empowering a community to coordinate time spent with children or elders.

- **Commons Hubs**
    
    Physical community “third spaces” are critical for education, culture, and community wellness. Templates for this civic stack would support the acquisition of real estate, shared use and ownership agreements regarding the financial needs and offerings of the space, and governance mechanisms for coordinating essential services and functions. These “third spaces,” in turn, would offer the community a place to convene, learn, share art, and engage in community wellness offerings like yoga, martial arts, sauna, or cold plunges.

- **Tool Libraries**
    
    Already well utilized in communities around the world, tool libraries are a civic stack that facilitates the shared use of expensive equipment that would otherwise not be available to the individual. Designing such a system using blockchain mechanisms like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and DAO governance would facilitate streamlined and accountable access to shared resources. By providing templates for this proven civic stack, communities would be further empowered to share existing resources.

### Framework In Use

Grounding the framework in an applied use case, let’s explore the story of Tracy, a community member on the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. **Tracy has noticed a decline of pollinators in her area and is concerned about the cascading loss of biodiversity that arises out of poor land use policy and management.**

She writes up a mission, vision, and purpose statement using a Cultural DNA and Initial Membrane Formation template she discovered on the _open protocol library_ with a clear plan to support a distributed movement of citizens planting pollinator gardens. She calls the project, “Pollinator People,” and sends the proposal to a few core friends who she knows share her interest. They meet at a local cafe to define the approach they might take to the collaborative process, governance methods, and mapping out the various types of community organizations, non-profits, and government agencies that might be interested in the project. They combine a few different elements from the _open protocol library_ to compose a stack that utilizes Theory U for collaborative project design, consensus decision making for big group decisions, clearly defined sociocratic working groups with representative linking roles, and a biodiversity tracking template.

Tracy lists the project on Open Collective to raise some community donations and submits a grant application to her local government’s climate resilience program. Along with her early co-founders, Tracy raises a few thousand dollars for supplies and a small stipend for the core team. Tracy makes a post on social media inviting her community to a launch event for the project on a Saturday afternoon at the local library. There, community members divide up into teams for the various work streams outlined in her proposal. Teams develop to research the best pollinator plants for their bioregion, generate a coordination plan for deciding which backyards of community members they want to plant in first, and an impact evaluation team to document the process and its outcomes on local pollinators. The working groups reconvene as a larger group to participate in a consensus-building dialogue designed to confirm alignment around their approach. Each team makes a proposal for the amount of the total available grant funding they need for their portion of the project and they all agree to document their activities and expenses using one of the decentralized project management interfaces they discovered in the _open protocol library_. The impact evaluation group creates a Google Drive workspace to save all the documents and shares it to the WhatsApp group Tracy has created for the project.

After a few working group meetings, the project is ready to plant their pollinator gardens. Each weekend for two months, the group meets in a different community member’s backyard to plant pollinator gardens together. Tracy invites a local musician to play music and the work parties become a community highlight of the summer, a family-friendly and service-oriented activity that brings the whole community together. After the planting, the impact evaluation group provides a citizen science framework to all the homes where pollinator gardens are planted. At the end of the season, the impact evaluation group colates all the citizen science data and generates a report of the project’s successes and learnings. With the entire process designed using open protocols and documented through open, collaborative documents, Tracy and her community are able to refine the process the next season, share their learnings and recipe for their civic stack to the open protocol library, and apply for retroactive and future grant funding.
