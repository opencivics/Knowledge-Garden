## Making The Old System Obsolete

Together, these enabling structures, composed of interoperable civic utilities, form new kinds of civic systems. These systems may be hard for us to conceive at present, given just how degraded our civil society and commons have become. But as our current systems continue to crumble around us, our imagination is the primary limitation on the kind of world that we can create next. Open civic systems simply make old systems obsolete by providing a higher quality of life for citizens by making better use out of existing resources, leveraging local knowledge and problem-solving, and anchoring networks of relationships. With this possibility as our north star, we peer ahead, beyond the horizon of our current systems, towards the rising sun of the third attractor.

## Three Horizons & The Third Attractor

Within the [three horizons framework](https://training.itcilo.org/delta/Foresight/3-Horizons.pdf) approach to change management and paradigmatic shifts, the first horizon (H1) represents business as usual. The second horizon (H2) represents adaptations that occur in response to the failures of the status quo. These adaptations can prolong the dysfunction of the status quo by marginally addressing its insufficiencies (H2-) or they can create the enabling conditions for an entirely new horizon (H3) to emerge (H2+).

An analysis of the depth and scope of the meta-crisis’ generator functions reveals that H2- innovations are not only ‘too little, too late’ when it comes to addressing the perverse economic incentives and regulatory capture that drive ecocide and anti-social behaviors, they're also likely to prolong the long disaster that we're currently embedded within. As such, it is critical to describe the third horizon or third attractor in greater detail, both to ensure any transitional approaches are indeed H2+, and to guide a process of distributed coordination towards the underlying frameworks and initiatives that will increase the probability of the third attractor’s emergence.

This section of the thesis attempts to define the third horizon in the form of open civic systems, a design philosophy based on the indicators and design principles of a life-affirming civilization.

Open refers to a design philosophy akin to the design of [open source software](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772723000532). To empower truly distributed coordination in the re-imagination of our core civilizational systems, an open design approach enables any participant to modify, fork, or merge a design pattern in an evolutionary process of adaptation and natural selection.

Civic refers to the systems of care that undergird the incentives, infrastructures, and institutions of any given civilization. By focusing our attention on these underlying systems, we are able to shape the downstream flows of our democracies and economies.

According to Donella Meadows, “a system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time. The system may be buffeted, constricted, triggered, or driven by outside forces. But the system’s response to these forces is characteristic of itself.” In short, a system is a set of feedback loops between components that produce their own emergent behaviors and effects. Thinking in terms of systems, instead of in terms of individual components, is essential to meaningfully and effectively engage with the complexity of our world.

The sections that follow will provide an overview of open civic systems as a precursor for the a distributed coordination framework for the development and deployment of such systems.
