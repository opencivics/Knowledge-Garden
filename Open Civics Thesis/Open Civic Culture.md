Properly understood, the systemic drivers of the meta-crisis make it clear that incremental and institutional solutions are ultimately insufficient in the face of the entrenched, systemic crises we face. The combination of the sluggish rate of adaptation and centralized approaches to change management within institutions calls for a more foundational and participatory strategy.

Understood as an adaptation and coordination failure, the meta-crisis only truly resolves through what Daniel Schmachtenberger has referred to as a “civic renaissance.” Implicit in the term renaissance is the notion of rebirth and revitalization, a return to something that has been lost or degraded. In this sense, a civic renaissance is a return to a shared sense of mutual responsibility and care, rooted in an understanding that there is no “away” and it is within one’s rational self interest to care for the wellbeing of our commons, communities, and planet.

Civic virtue is the personal expression of a broader cultural renaissance, referring to the ennobling choice to rise into stewardship and direct responsibility for the maintenance and embodiment of systems of care.

This type of civic culture is a precursor to the types of distributed coordination required to address the root drivers of the meta-crisis in our local communities and global commons. At the core, this shift revolves around ending our a reliance on centralized institutions to provision core civilizational utilities by restoring our fundamental rights as planetary citizens to self-determine and autopoetically enact our own civilizational systems through self-organizing collective action.

Unlike crises humanity has faced in the past, the complex, existential and all-encompassing nature of climatic shifts, supply chain breakdowns, and food system fragility require distributed, cosmo-local resilience and direct action.

For humanity to truly become a non-rivalrous, mutually responsible species, we must first develop the cultural and systemic coordination capacities to effectively respond. Waiting for large institutions to coordinate our response will likely be too little, too late.
