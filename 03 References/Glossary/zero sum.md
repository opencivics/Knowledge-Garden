A situation in which any gain by one party is exactly balanced by a loss to another party. This means that the total amount of resources, benefits, or wealth remains constant, and one person’s gain is another person’s loss. Zero-sum scenarios are often used in game theory and economics to describe competitive situations where the interests of participants are directly opposed.
