An approach to understanding and solving complex problems by viewing them as part of an overall system, rather than in isolation. It involves recognizing the interconnections and relationships between different components of a system and understanding how changes in one part can affect the whole.Â This method emphasizes looking at patterns and dynamics over time, rather than static snapshots.
