According to [[Moral Imaginations]], **imagination activism** involves expanding and exercising one’s imagination to broaden ways of thinking and envisioning what is possible and achievable. An imagination activist not only enhances their own imaginative capacities but also equips themselves with tools, questions, and exercises to help others expand their imaginations. [This approach aims to shift perceptions and translate new ways of thinking into actionable changes](https://medium.com/moral-imaginations/imagination-activism-in-camden-a9f786650119).
