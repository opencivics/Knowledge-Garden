The term post-tragic refers to a state or condition that emerges after experiencing a tragic event. Unlike the concept of post-traumatic, which often focuses on the lingering negative effects and trauma, post-tragic emphasizes a transformative process. It involves moving beyond the initial suffering and finding meaning, growth, or a new perspective as a result of the tragedy. This concept is often used in literature, psychology, and philosophy to describe how individuals or societies can evolve and find resilience after profound loss or hardship.
