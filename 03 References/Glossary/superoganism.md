A group of synergistically interacting organisms of the same species that function together as a single, cohesive entity. This concept is often applied to social insects like ants, bees, and termites, where the colony operates as a unified whole with specialized roles and division of labor. Individual members of the superorganism cannot survive for extended periods on their own, as their survival and functionality are deeply interconnected with the group.
