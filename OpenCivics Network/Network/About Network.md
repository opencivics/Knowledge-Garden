The **OpenCivics Network** is a decentralized solidarity network and community of practice that includes civic innovators organizers, and patrons in a participatory and non-rivalrous co-design process, supporting coordination, funding, and applied research into systemic interventions that support direct civic empowerment.

Together, the [[1 OpenCivics Foundation|OpenCivics Foundation]], [[About Consortium|OpenCivics Consortium]], and [[About Labs|OpenCivics Labs]], serve the [[OpenCivics Network/Network/About Network|OpenCivics Network]]

These organizational forms are largely a function of legacy legal structures but also reflect overlapping focus areas that synergistically weave together the key activities of aligning, coordinating, funding, researching, educating, and empowering the improvement of civic systems that are important for the public good.
