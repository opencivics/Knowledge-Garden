The [[About Labs|OpenCivics Labs]] serves the Network as a private research and development cooperative of systems thinkers, facilitators, designers, and researchers on the cutting edge of distributed governance and collaborative process design. The Labs fill the gap between the collaborative initiatives of the Consortium and the more specific services required for the facilitation and formation of collaborative public goods or social impact networks â€“ as well as the bespoke development of specific commons IP and civic utilities. 

****All Labs partners commit the IP generated through the contract into the commons. These limitations on revenue generating activity are designed to ensure that OpenCivics Labs perpetually places the OpenCivics mission ahead of any short term financial incentives.
