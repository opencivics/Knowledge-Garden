We envision a vital, resilient, and participatory civilization

#### Current Reality

Misaligned incentives and the concentration of wealth and power often leads to corrupt and ineffective institutions that neglect the real needs of people and the planet.

#### Possible Future

Empowered citizens guide our shared futures through direct democracies and local economies, creating collective agency, transparency, and accountability

# / Our audacious vision

We believe in a future in which humanity has successfully moved through our current evolutionary eye of the needle without destroying the substrate of living systems upon which we depend. In such a civilization, our open civic culture orients our open civic systems towards life-affirming ways of being.

#### Vitality

The embodied state of _thriving_ that emerges from the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies.

#### Resilience

The state and the _capacity_ for adaptive self-organization sufficient to provide core life support function across changing world circumstances.

#### Choice

The state of respect for the sovereign _agency_ of all beings and the capacity of individual agents to participate and influence their circumstances.
