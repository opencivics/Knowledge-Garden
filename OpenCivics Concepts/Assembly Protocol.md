Assembly Protocol is a method for assembling open civic systems. The protocol provides a critical link between the participatory design process described above and the knowledge commons where the outputs of others can be stored and referenced.

First, a need is identified. As a first step in the initial alignment process, civic innovators should consult an open civic knowledge commons to evaluate what existing approaches have already been generated. Beginning by identifying the appropriate civic sector related to the perceived need, individuals can locate the pattern that best describes the combination of need and opportunity that they sense in their local community. If no pattern exists, skip the following step. 

If a pattern does exist within the knowledge commons, individuals will then explore the pluralistic set of protocol and playbook blueprints that are referenced within the pattern. If one of these is suitable, the individual may begin iteratively deploying it in their own community. If modification is necessary, the individual may fork the protocol / playbook blueprint and make modifications throughout the remainder of their community organizing initiative.

If no pattern or protocol / playbook blueprints exist or meet the needs of the innovator, an initial mapping process should be conducted to begin to compose a pattern definition as well as a template for the prospective open civic system.

Once this mapping process is complete, continue through the remainder of the participatory activities outlined above.

When complete, learnings from the process should be documented as a protocol / playbook blueprint and shared to the knowledge commons with linking to the appropriate pattern.

### Composing Open Civic Systems

Open civic systems can be simultaneously understood as living systems, social organisms, and protocol systems. Viewing these procedural and biomimetic structures through those lenses helps us orient to the composition of components that unleash emergent capacities.

Composing Civic System as Living Systems...

- Living systems are inherently complex, composed of dynamic interactions between agents within an ecology.
- Composing open civic systems through this lens encourages us to consider how interactions and flows can stack functions and offer cascading benefits through the positive-sum exchange between components of the system.

**Civic Systems as Social Organisms...**

- Social organisms are macro-organisms that develop a kind of collective agency while retaining the uniqueness and individual agency of component parts.
- Composing open civic systems through this lens encourages us to balance the needs of the collective with the needs of the individual, developing mechanisms that align incentives and ensure the consent of all participants while maintaining coherence and collective action.

**Civic Systems as Protocol Systems...**

- Protocol systems structure interactions between agents through clearly defined agreements and processes.
- Composing open civic systems through this lens encourages us to define pathways of interaction between agents through a clearly defined and mutually agreed upon set of protocols that make it clear how individuals can participate and contribute.

### Public Templates

Public templates, shared as modular and open-source protocol and playbook blueprints, are designed to listen to the authentic needs of communities and empower them to address these challenges independently. They are crafted to be participatory, not autocratic, ensuring that innovations are deeply rooted in local contexts while also being accessible to communities worldwide. The use of a protocol pattern language not only introduces structured mechanisms but also fosters a way of thinking that transforms these mechanisms into adaptable tools. Each template is composed of interchangeable components, creating a flexible framework where elements can be tailored or replaced to meet diverse, evolving requirements.
