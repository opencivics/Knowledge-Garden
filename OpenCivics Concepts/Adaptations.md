Based on these activities, intermediate adaptations are the short term outputs of our primary forms of service. These near term adaptations are essential preconditions for the broader impacts we aspire to create.

#### Open Civic Culture

An open civic culture would demonstrate an ontological shift into a worldview of interbeing, an embodiment of Martin Luther King Jrâ€™s Beloved Community. A critical precondition for a fully participatory, regenerative, and resilient civilization, this renewal of the social contract represents a key intermediate outcome for OpenCivics. By providing civic utilities that create a scaffold for this new and ancient worldview, we are supporting the development of a civic culture of participation and stewardship rooted in a shared sense of mutual belonging and responsibility for the wellbeing of our communities, commons, and ecologies.

#### Open Civic Systems

An open civic system represents a dynamic transformation of how communities coordinate and create together, embodying the interconnectedness of living systems. By fostering stigmergic self-organization and adaptive co-creation, these systems are the structural backbone for participatory, vital, and resilient societies. Serving as scaffolds for collaborative action, open civic systems offer flexible frameworks for communities to align and innovate on shared solutions, cultivating an ecosystem of mutual stewardship and localized innovation.
