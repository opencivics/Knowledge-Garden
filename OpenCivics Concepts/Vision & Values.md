**We envision a human civilization that is participatory, vital, and resilient.**

We believe in a future in which humanity has successfully moved through our current evolutionary eye of the needle without destroying the substrate of living systems upon which we depend. In such a civilization, our civic paradigm – our culture and systems – are oriented towards life-affirming ways of being.

Three values form a north star that helps us to evaluate the systemic ethics and outcomes of our adaptations. These values represent both a shared collective intent as well as a rubric for peer evaluation of our work towards these shared aims.

[[Vitality]] is the embodied state of _thriving_ that emerges from the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies.

[[Choice]] is the state of fundamental respect for the sovereign _agency_ of all beings and the capacity of individual agents to participate and influence their circumstances.

[[Resilience]] is the state and the _capacity_ for adaptive self-organization sufficient to provide core life support function across changing world circumstances.
