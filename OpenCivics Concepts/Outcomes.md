As the public becomes increasingly empowered and enculturated in the pro-social behaviors of a worldview of interbeing embodied in open civic culture, higher level outcomes will begin to unfold as a natural consequence of the scaling and adoption of open civics systems.

#### Self-Governed Institutions

When civic utilities are developed in communities around the world, they will begin to provide the same core services that traditional institutions once did. Driven by a renaissance in civic engagement, civic culture, and civic virtue, these new kinds of institutions will normalize the participatory stewardship of our communities and commons, eventually replacing legacy institutions as they proliferate, iterate, and develop their capacities.

#### Incentives Aligned With Wellbeing

Regenerative worker-owned cooperatives, combined with civic utilities powered by open protocols that encode new value systems into infrastructure, can align economic and democratic systems with the will of the people and their commitment to the wellbeing of all life. By embedding economic and governance processes within participatory, self-governed civic utilities and social organisms, decision-making and revenue-generating activities can prioritize mutual benefit, non-coercion, and holistic thriving as the standard.

#### Cosmo-Local Infrastructures

As civic utilities are developed – in some cases, utilizing the OpenCivics Innovation Framework– a lattice of interoperable civilizational public goods will create a basin of attraction for a parallel society. As these infrastructures stack and connect, a civic hyperstructure contributes towards a fully participatory, networked civilization that is grounded in civic stewardship and responsibility. As this lattice proliferates, the cosmo-local design pattern of hyper-local infrastructures that are intended to feed back into larger scales supports a post-nation state future emerging out of bioregional and watershed scales of self-organization.
