*A term coined by futurist Kevin Kelly to describe a state of society that is continuously improving, rather than aiming for a perfect utopia or falling into a dystopia. Unlike utopia, which represents an ideal and often unattainable perfect state, [protopia](https://metamoderna.org/whats-the-difference-between-utopia-eutopia-and-protopia/) focuses on incremental progress and ongoing positive change.Â It acknowledges that while perfection is impossible, we can always strive to make things better, even if only by a small margin each day.*
