Open civic innovation is the collaborative improvement of civic systems that are important for the public good. Civic innovation seeks to restore and renew the spirit of collective stewardship of our commons and communities by providing novel mechanisms for civic stewardship.

When our legacy civic institutions fail to provide such mechanisms for holistic well-being and collective stewardship, it falls to us as innovators and as citizens to listen to the needs of our communities and develop new civic systems that directly improve our quality of life.

The process of open civic innovation is led by civic innovators, local community organizers and patrons, who choose to collaborate and create the enabling conditions for all relevant stakeholders to be engaged in a participatory process of civic stewardship.

**Civic innovators** coordinate the development of civic utilities, coalescing into outputs that are useful for **civic organizers** to deploy in their local communities, funded by **civic patrons** who share an interest in systemic transformation.

The participation of each actor is similarly catalyzed by the identification of a gap in their communities they care about and a choice to act.
