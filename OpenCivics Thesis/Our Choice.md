> “The impossible happens.” — R. Buckminster Fuller

Our collective future remains a mystery. And yet, around the world there is a rising yearning for profound systemic change. Ignored by legacy institutions of politics, media, and technology, this yearning can be harnessed by those who provide a sincere, distributed, and coordinated avenue for direct participation in the reimagining of our world.

We call the bluff of narratives of progress and naive techno-optimism that tell us to stay home on Tik Tok, placing orders on Amazon while the world burns around us and our so-called leaders continue to shred the future of the rising Millennial and Gen Z generations through further extraction, military spending and indebtedness.

While we cannot predict when a large-scale planetary revolution will occur, we can prepare the soil for its optimal success. We envision the next Occupy Wall Street, Arab Spring, or Sunflower Movement occurring with the support of the civic utilities we create today. Instead of protesting corrupted and dying institutions, the defining movements of the 21st century can and must hold a positive image of the future that expands the scope of our imagination and guides our collective action towards creativity and experimentation.

In these uncertain times, civilizational collapse scenarios are abundant. From top-soil degradation and food system collapse to climate mass migration to extreme weather to biological warfare and the looming threat of mass global conflict, we can’t predict when and how our systems will collapse, but we can say with certainty that the [long disaster](https://medium.com/beyond-burning-man/the-long-disaster-3e5bd0ad4d33) of late stage capitalism has already begun.

As such, it is our responsibility as innovators and as a public to build the lifeboats and parallel systems that can catch humanity as it falls from one social order into another. It is both our ethical duty as well as our transformative opportunity to align, coordinate, resource, collaborate, convene, and learn as a global community developing the civic infrastructures of a world built upon love, care, and mutuality, empowering the public to co-steward and self-determine our collective future, together.

In Us We Trust.
