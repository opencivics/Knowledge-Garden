**Welcome to the OpenCivics Network Wiki**

OpenCivics is a solidarity network and community of practice where civic innovators, stewards, and patrons collaborate to address the complex challenges of our time. Our focus is on fostering regenerative, decentralized solutions that strengthen self-organized civic participation and stewardship across communities. 

This wiki is a living knowledge commons, built for transparency and shared understanding within the network. Here, you’ll find guidance on our [[About Thesis|thesis]], [[About Framework|framework]], [[About OpenCivics/About Network|network]], and [[OpenCivics Network/Membership/About Membership|membership]].

We believe that together, we can revitalize civic culture and create thriving, resilient civic systems that serve both people and the planet. It's time to root down and rise up — welcome to the 🕳️🐇
