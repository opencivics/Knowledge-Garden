**Welcome to the OpenCivics Wiki.** 

OpenCivics is a solidarity network and community of practice where civic innovators, stewards, and patrons collaborate to address the complex challenges of our time. Our focus is on fostering regenerative, decentralized solutions that strengthen civic participation and stewardship across communities. 

This wiki is a living document, built for transparency and shared understanding within our community. Here, you’ll find comprehensive guidance on our [[About Thesis|thesis]], [[About Framework|framework]], [[About OpenCivics/About Network|network]], and [[OpenCivics Network/Membership/About Membership|membership]] – designed to empower communities, civic innovators, and leaders alike. 

We believe that together, we can revitalize civic culture and create thriving, resilient civic systems that serve both people and the planet. 

It's time to root down and rise up — welcome to the journey!
