While transitional interventions are necessary to mitigate harm and formalize a bridge into the third attractor, they are effectively grafting the social DNA of the ontological shift into dead or dying institutions that require a whole systems upgrade. This thesis proposes that the emergent civic culture of the 21st century will be highly localized, process-oriented, and ecologically contextualized in response to an ethical and strategic necessity to orient humanity’s collective agency to defining, designing, and deploying civic systems that create the enabling conditions for the third attractor.

The OpenCivics Innovation Framework is a design process that supports the coordination of open civic innovation. As a minimum viable coordination infrastructure, the framework is designed to maximize the interoperability of civic utilities as well as to foreground a participatory, pluralistic and polycentric approach to creating civic systems.

As such, the framework is an _infrastructural_ foundation upon which alternative open civic systems may be built.

This “third horizon” thinking is pre-figurative and imaginal while remaining pragmatic and grounded. It opens a design space in which the next epoch of open civic systems may be explored and co-evolved through bottom-up, participatory means.

The framework scaffolds/represents a modular, interoperable, composable, and inclusive approach to civic innovation that models civic systems off of the development of open source software, stigmergic living systems patterns, open standards bodies, the symbiotic intelligence of an artistic or cultural scene, and commons self-governance principles.

This approach builds towards the innovation of civic systems as open protocols; open civic systems. A meta-protocol for composing civic systems as social organisms is offered as a pattern language that enables a participatory, pluralistic and polycentric approach. Effectively, this is an open protocol for producing open protocols.

Thus, this thesis attempts to offer a sketch of an underlying grammar [and/or syntax | logic] for distributed coordination, ie an open civics. This grammar proposes an underlying schema for self-organizing processes and resilient, place-based and cosmo-local infrastructures that provide the enabling conditions for a fundamentally post-capitalist and even post-nation state human civilization.

By providing an initial schema that correlates the fundamental categories, functions, and processes of distributed coordination, this thesis outlines both the core functions of OpenCivics Network as a set of mechanisms as well as a coherent, overarching framework for a fully participatory process of civilizational adaptation.

By linking the many commons and peer to peer efforts to revitalize the civic design space, this ontological framework provides a foundation for a fully distributed process, governed by those who engage in it. This model is not intended to be complete or final in any sense, rather it offers a schelling point, a point of convergence and underlying schema to coordinate the process of systemic adaptation and co-evo_lution._

As such, this model is intended to be co-evolved through participatory stewardship. Instead of proposing this framework as definitive or absolute, this thesis approaches design process as a necessary **minimum viable coordination mechanism** and continuously evolving scaffolding in support of the emergence and co-creation of interoperable, modular, and participatory open protocols.

Embracing the ontological shift into a worldview of interbeing, core societal functions are reframed as nested wholes that provide mutually reinforcing, cascading benefits for the social ecology within which they participate. By reimagining society’s infrastructures, incentives, and institutions through a fundamentally living systems lens, this framework is intended to support a broad societal shift into an ecological understanding of right relationship, reciprocity, and flow. Composing civic utilities in this context, the emergent social organisms that unfold are structured in a universal language of Life that supports the interoperable continuity, holonic nesting, and stigmergic coordination of human societal functions.

As an alignment and coordination strategy, composing social organisms utilizing this framework supports a commons process of participatory feedback and learning, allowing social organisms to evolve organically through a cosmo-local process of experimentation, iteration, and co-creation.

Civic utilities or civic stacks are composed of the fundamental building blocks or elements of social organisms that are fractal in nature and contain various self-referencing components that can be stacked and composed into living processes.
