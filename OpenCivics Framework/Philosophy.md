Beginning with a set of values and principles, the framework offers a set of theoretical foundations as a fundamental design philosophy for open civic innovation.

## Values

As innovators working towards new systems, it is critical for us to hold shared ethical principles with regards to the desired _output_ of our work. These system design ethics form a rubric for the collective evaluation of any civic system.

#### Vitality

The embodied state of _thriving_ that emerges from the interconnected levels of well-being and quality of life for individuals, communities, and ecologies.

#### Resilience

The state and the _capacity_ for adaptive self-organization sufficient to provide core life support function across changing world circumstances.

#### Choice

The state of respect for the sovereign _agency_ of all beings and the capacity of individual agents to participate and influence their circumstances.


## Principles

The qualities of the [third attractor](https://dodecahedron-stingray-np3t.squarespace.com/open-civic-innovation-framework#) that guide the innovation process, these design principles are essential for building robust, adaptable, scalable and equitable civic systems that can effectively serve diverse communities.

#### Modular

**Modular** refers to the design principle where a system is divided into separate, self-contained units or modules. Each module can function independently but can also be combined with other modules to create a more complex system. This approach allows for flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance, as individual modules can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.

#### Composable

**Composable** refers to the capability of a system to be assembled from various components or modules in different configurations to meet specific needs. In the context of open civic systems, composability allows for the creation of tailored solutions by combining different modules, enabling adaptability and customization based on the unique requirements of different communities or projects.

#### Interoperable

**Interoperable** describes the ability of different systems, organizations, or components to work together seamlessly. In open civic systems, interoperability ensures that various modules or platforms can exchange information and function together effectively, regardless of their underlying technologies or architectures. This is crucial for creating cohesive and efficient civic solutions.

#### Inclusive

**Inclusive** means ensuring that the system is accessible and usable by all individuals, regardless of their background, abilities, or circumstances. In open civic systems, inclusivity involves designing with diverse user needs in mind, promoting equity, and ensuring that everyone can participate and benefit from the system. This includes considerations for accessibility, language, and cultural relevance.
